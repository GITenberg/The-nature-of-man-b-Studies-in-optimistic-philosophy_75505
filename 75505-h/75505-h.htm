  <h2 class='c005'>EDITOR’S INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>When Pasteur died a remarkable article appeared in one of
the Paris newspapers. The writer described the intimate
routine of the life at the Pasteur Institute, and compared it
with that of a mediæval religious community. A little body
of men, forsaking the world and the things of the world,
had gathered together under the compulsion of a great idea.
They had given up the rivalries and personal interests of
ordinary men, and, sharing their goods and their work, they
lived in austere devotion to science, finding no sacrifice of
health or money, or of what men call pleasure, too great for
the common object. Rumours of war and peace, echoes of
the turmoil of politics and religion, passed unheeded over
their monastic seclusion; but if there came news of a strange
disease in China or Peru, a scientific emissary was ready with
his microscope and his tubes to serve as a missionary of the
new knowledge and the new hope that Pasteur had brought
to suffering humanity. The adventurous exploits and the
patient vigils of this new Order have brought about a revolution
in our knowledge of disease, and there seems no limit
to the triumphs that will come from the parent Institute in
Paris and from its many daughters in other cities.</p>

<p class='c007'>Élie Metchnikoff, now Professor at the Pasteur Institute
in Paris, is one of the most distinguished of the disciples
who left all else to follow Pasteur. He was born on the
third (16) May, 1845, in a village of the Government of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_iv'>iv</span>Kharkoff (Little Russia). He was educated at the Gymnasium
and the University of Kharkoff, passing through the
Faculty of Science. From 1864 to 1870 he worked at
Zoology at Giessen, Göttingen and Munich, successively
under three well-known zoologists, Leuckhart, Henle and
Von Siebold, and was then appointed Professor of Zoology
and Comparative Anatomy at Odessa. He made expeditions
to Madeira, Teneriffe and the Kalmuck Steppes in
connection with his zoological researches. In 1882, in consequence
of administrative difficulties, arising as part of the
troubles that followed the murder of the Tzar, Alexander
II., he resigned the Professorship and became Director of
the municipal Bacteriological Laboratory. In 1888 he went
to the Pasteur Institute, and has remained there since that
time.</p>

<p class='c007'>The earlier part of Metchnikoff’s career was devoted to
Zoology, and chiefly to investigation of the embryological
history of the lower invertebrates, and the sequence of his
discoveries should afford food for reflection to those Baconian
economists who are unwilling to shelter any tree of knowledge
that does not give immediate promise of marketable
fruit. The labour of many years spent in minute tracing of
the development of insects, echinoderms, worms and jellyfish,
would appear sufficiently unprofitable to those who
give a scanty support to Botany as the provider of drugs,
who tolerate Chemistry because it has supplied aniline dyes,
and who patronise the physical sciences from a lively sense
of the convenience of telephones and telegraphs. And yet
from these remote, inhuman interests, Metchnikoff, without
intellectual transition, passed directly to results affecting
vitally the human race, and became one of the high priests
of Bacteriology and a guardian of the Pandora’s box of
modern times.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_v'>v</span>From observations made originally on water-fleas, he was
led to discover the functions of the white corpuscles of
human blood. He showed by what mechanism these made
perpetual war against the intruding microbes of disease, and
he laid the foundations of knowledge as to the agencies that
weaken and the modes of strengthening these guardians of
our health. In a series of investigations into the phenomena
of inflammation in men and lower animals, he carried his
observations into new fields, and explained the relations of
the white corpuscles to the juices that attract and repel them
(chemotaxis). It was he, for instance, who discovered that
these corpuscles, under certain circumstances, migrate into
the hairs and absorb and remove the pigment, so producing
the blanching of old age. Although popularly the most interesting
this was far from being the most important of the
changes of senile decay that he found to be due to the
activity of the wandering cells of the body. And, as will
be seen in the present volume, the actions and interactions
of the bacteria harboured in the body, the white corpuscles
that are a natural part of the body, and the various juices
or serums produced naturally or introduced by accident or
design, are concerned in life itself and the decay of life.</p>

<p class='c007'>Metchnikoff is an expert of experts in the science of life,
and has gained the right to a hearing by forty years of patient
devotion and brilliant research. In the volume that
he has now given to the public, he has addressed himself to
the gravest and the most serious problems of humanity, to
life and sex and death and the fear of death. From the
earliest days when man could spare time from the satisfaction
of his immediate wants to reflect upon his nature and
destiny, these problems and the invention of fantastic solutions
or evasive anodynes have absorbed his attention. The
folklore and philosophy, the religion and poetry of all races
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>and of all stages of culture, from savage barbarism to decadent
refinement, revolve round these obsessions of the
mind, and, as Metchnikoff most plainly shows, no enduring
comfort has yet been found. Now for the first time in the
history of thought, the exact methods of science have been
brought to the statement of the problems.</p>

<p class='c007'>In revising this translation of Metchnikoff’s book for the
English-speaking public I have had to content myself with
seeing that the plain meaning of the French was transformed
to plain English, and that references to French editions were
changed, so far as was possible, to corresponding references
to English editions. Some of the phrases that recur were
difficult to express. “Human nature” for instance is not
an exact equivalent of <em>la nature humaine</em>, for the latter
phrase has a complete significance, and very definitely implies
not only the mental qualities of man, but his bodily
framework, with its inherited and acquired anatomical structure
and physiological functions. The phrase “human constitution,”
especially in the common medical sense, carries
more of the meaning, and I have used it occasionally. The
word “harmony” means harmony with the environment,
and disharmony is want of harmony or imperfect adaptation
to the existing environment. In the case of the human
organism, which has passed through profound changes at a
rate prodigious in the history of evolution, many parts of
the constitution are no longer in gear with the existing
environment, and it is in such disharmonies that Metchnikoff
finds the source of the troubles that have perplexed
mankind.</p>

<p class='c007'>In several parts of this volume, and particularly in the
chapter dealing with disharmonies in the reproductive functions,
there is much plain speaking on matters that modern
civilisation attempts to conceal. I have not had the impertinence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>to suppress or to alter a line or a word of these
pages. They are written in high seriousness on fundamental
facts of the constitution of man; they relate to problems
and difficulties that every age in the history of man has had
to face, and that are dealt with in the plainest language in
the books of all the religions. For the first time proper
knowledge has been brought to the task, and it is to be remembered
that this volume is an attempt to explain mysteries
of the flesh and of the spirit of which all existing
explanations have failed to satisfy humanity. The volume
is avowedly no more than a preliminary statement, a rallying-point
for the work of future generations. But it awakens
a new hope for humanity now that the old are fallen dumb;
as Metchnikoff himself says, “If it be true that man cannot
live without faith, this volume, when the age of faith seemed
gone by, has provided a new faith, that in the all-powerfulness
of science.” In every country, the new Order of priests
of science, in the vigils of the laboratory, is working for the
future of humanity.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In offering this book to you, reader, I feel that I must justify
its publication. I admit freely that more could be said for
a finished study in which hypotheses were replaced by
exact fact. But to get together assured results in a field
so little explored is a great task, calling for time and much
labour.</p>

<p class='c007'>I remembered the adage, “<em>Ars longa, vita brevis</em>,” and
I decided to publish what is really a programme of work to
be carried out as fully as circumstances may permit. At
all events, I hope that such a programme may have its
value for younger investigators, who wish a point of orientation
for their labours.</p>

<p class='c007'>My book is addressed to disciplined minds, and in especial
to biologists. As I wrote it, I had not the general public
in my mind, and so I did not hesitate to devote nearly the
whole of a chapter to “disharmonies in the apparatus of
reproduction.” I see in that apparatus the clearest proof of
the essential disharmony in the organisation of man.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have to thank those friends who were familiar with my
views and whose advice and assistance have helped me to
develop them.</p>

<p class='c007'>In particular, I desire to thank my friends Dr. E. Roux,
who was at the pains to make my French more French;
and Dr. J. Goldschmidt and Dr. Mesnil, who have read and
revised the proof-sheets.</p>

of man as the foundation of morality—Greek worship of
human nature—Matriopathy of ancient philosophers—Rationalism
of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries—Degradation

<p class='c006'>Notwithstanding the real advance made by science,
expressions of discontentment with it are familiar. Science,
it is said, no doubt has ameliorated the material conditions
of human life, but is powerless to solve those moral and
philosophical questions that interest cultured people so
deeply. In this region science has done no more than to
destroy the foundations of religion. It has robbed mankind
of the consolations of religion without being able to
replace them with anything more exact or more enduring.</p>

<p class='c007'>It cannot be disputed that a general uneasiness disturbs
the world of to-day. Although his environment is most
favourable to the fulfilment of many of his capacities, man
finds himself without orientation when he has to determine
the course of his life, or to explain to himself his true relation
to such categories of humanity as family, nation,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>race and human race. This uneasiness reveals itself as
discontentment, and it leads to pessimism or to mysticism.
Most of the philosophical systems of the nineteenth century
were steeped in melancholy, and led straight to a
denial of the possibility of happiness and even to an advocacy
of extinction. The frequency of suicide has increased
greatly among all the civilised peoples. There is no need
to tabulate proofs of a notorious fact.<a id='r1'></a><a href='#f1' class='c014'><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>A remedy for this malady of the age has been sought
in the attempt to restore religious and mystical faith.
On all sides have sprung up efforts to found new religions
or to amend the old. Many defenders of science have
gone the length of admitting its incapacity to solve the
problem of the existence of man; they have held that that
problem was insoluble for the human mind. Such a depressing
conclusion has been formulated in spite of many attempts
to reach a rational conception of the universe and of man.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is no new thing to ask if there be nothing but faith
to control human conduct and to lead mankind towards
universal happiness. Men of science and philosophers,
in many ages, have thought that human nature itself could
provide all the materials for a rational morality.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the ancient world and, above all, among the Greeks,
human nature was held in high esteem. The Oriental
races, predecessors of the Greeks in civilisation, generally
represented their gods as fantastic or grotesque beings,
composites of men and animals. The Greeks made gods
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>in their own image, giving them all the most beautiful
qualities of the human race. Such a conception was a
dominant factor in ancient Greek life and civilisation.
The adoration of Man embraced the human body, and led
to the despising of every mode of tampering with the
natural body. Thus, for instance, shaving<a id='r2'></a><a href='#f2' class='c014'><sup>[2]</sup></a> of the face
was regarded as a humiliation, for a smooth chin gave an
unnatural, womanish cast to the face of a man.</p>

<p class='c007'>The adoration of human nature by the Greeks appeared
in Greek plastic art, and was the cause of its excellence.
The ideal of art was to copy, in the most faithful way,
the most perfect example of the human body, and Greek
artists made measurements of the body so accurately
that modern science has confirmed their chief results.<a id='r3'></a><a href='#f3' class='c014'><sup>[3]</sup></a>
As sculpture most completely realised the Greek ideal of
the human body, it became almost a national art among
the Greeks.</p>

<p class='c007'>Greek philosophy had an equally high opinion of human
nature, of the human body, and of representations of the
human body. Just as Greek art aimed at the presentation
of the body of man, so Greek philosophy proclaimed the
nobility of all human qualities, and inculcated the doctrine
of a harmonious development of all sides of human
nature.<a id='r4'></a><a href='#f4' class='c014'><sup>[4]</sup></a> Such a doctrine was formulated by Plato, and
became a fundamental principle of the Old Academy;
the New Academy assumed it, and handed it on to the
Sceptics. According to Xenocrates (fourth century), who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>belonged to the Old Academy, happiness consisted not
only in the possession of human virtue, but in the accomplishment
of all natural acts.<a id='r5'></a><a href='#f5' class='c014'><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The principle of a worship of human nature is in itself
rather vague, and it is not surprising that disputes and contradictions
arose in relation to its application. Thus Plato
excluded pleasure from his conception of the good, while
Aristotle, Plato’s pupil, held a contrary opinion. For the
latter pleasure was the natural motive of human action, and
its attainment was associated as intimately with the perfect
life as beauty and health were associated with the perfect
human body.<a id='r6'></a><a href='#f6' class='c014'><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Under the name <em>Matriopathy</em> there arose, in the ancient
world, a doctrine the object of which was the study of
the goal of natural morality. This doctrine was held by
many philosophers, but these applied it to the details of
actual life in very different fashions. Thus, for the Stoics,
the <em>summum bonum</em> and happiness, the most lofty aim,
could not be found except by conforming life to nature.
Conduct was to be brought into harmony with the rational
order of nature in such a fashion that every conscious and
rational being would perform no actions that could not be
deduced from the general law.<a id='r7'></a><a href='#f7' class='c014'><sup>[7]</sup></a> The same principle of
a life in harmony with nature led the Epicureans to the
conclusion that “pleasure is a natural good, that is to
say, a condition conformable with nature, and so bringing
with it intrinsic contentment.”<a id='r8'></a><a href='#f8' class='c014'><sup>[8]</sup></a> Setting out from the same
fundamental principle, the theories of the Stoics and Epicureans
led in opposite directions.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>The Roman philosophers adopted the principle of a life
strictly natural. Seneca, for instance,<a id='r9'></a><a href='#f9' class='c014'><sup>[9]</sup></a> enunciated the
maxim: “Take nature as your guide, for so reason bids you
and advises you; to live happily is to live naturally.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Without following through the centuries the development
of the idea in detail, I may content myself with saying
that resort has been made to it, wherever there was sought,
outside the sanction of religion, a rational principle to guide
human conduct. It recurs even among those convinced
Christians who rebelled against the asceticism and hatred
of human nature that became prevalent in the early centuries
of the Christian era.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Greek conception of a life in harmony with nature
found its most complete development in the rationalism
of the Renaissance, and of the centuries that followed it.
Hutcheson,<a id='r10'></a><a href='#f10' class='c014'><sup>[10]</sup></a> a Scotch philosopher of the eighteenth century,
insisted that right was with the thinkers of the
naturalistic school, and that the realisation of their ideal
was to be considered as the highest virtue. He thus placed
himself directly against the Scotch clergy who asserted the
greatest contempt for human nature. Buckle<a id='r11'></a><a href='#f11' class='c014'><sup>[11]</sup></a> proclaimed
that it was a high honour for Hutcheson to have been the
first Scotchman to raise his voice publicly against the
degrading views of his time.</p>

<p class='c007'>The French philosophers of the eighteenth century, who
sought to replace the religious foundations of conduct by
rational principles, again had recourse to human nature.
Not long before the French Revolution there appeared a
treatise in three volumes, written by Baron d’Holbach,
and entitled, “Universal Morality, or the Duties of Man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>based on Nature.”<a id='r12'></a><a href='#f12' class='c014'><sup>[12]</sup></a> Frankly a materialist and atheist,
that writer laid it down as an axiom that “to be universal,
the moral law must be founded on the essential nature of
man, that is to say, on the properties and qualities found
constantly in the human being, and that distinguish him
from other animals.” To be well assured, “morality
presumes a science of human nature.”<a id='r13'></a><a href='#f13' class='c014'><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The principle of ancient philosophy reappeared in the
works of rationalists of the nineteenth century. Wilhelm
von Humboldt declared that “the ultimate ideal of man,
the ideal prescribed for him by the irrefutable and eternal
laws of reason, consisted in a development as harmonious
as possible of all his qualities in their entirety.” The
modern historian, Lecky,<a id='r14'></a><a href='#f14' class='c014'><sup>[14]</sup></a> defines the aim of life as the
full development of all that exists in the proportions determined
by nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>Philosophers and historians are not alone in the adoption
of Greek rationalism. Many naturalists, and among these
some very distinguished authors, have spoken in the same
sense. It is easy to see the Greek principle in such phrases
as those of Darwin<a id='r15'></a><a href='#f15' class='c014'><sup>[15]</sup></a> when he wrote: “The term general
good may be defined as the means by which the greatest
possible number of individuals can be reared in full vigour
and health, with all their faculties perfect, under the conditions
to which they are exposed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Georges Seidlitz,<a id='r16'></a><a href='#f16' class='c014'><sup>[16]</sup></a> an advocate of the great English
naturalist, got still nearer to the conception of the ancients.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>According to him, the moral and rational life consisted in
“the accomplishment of all the functions of the body, in
due but full proportion.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Herbert Spencer,<a id='r17'></a><a href='#f17' class='c014'><sup>[17]</sup></a> in analysing the aim of existence,
came to the conclusion that morality should be adjusted
so as to make life as full and complete as possible. As a
criterion of physical perfection, the English philosopher
would accept only the complete devotion of all the organs
to the accomplishment of all their functions, while his
criterion of moral perfection was contribution to the general
good. These views are plainly, if not exactly, expressions
of the Greek ideal.</p>

<p class='c007'>While, then, rational philosophers in all the ages have
sought the foundation of morality in human nature itself, and
have held human nature to be good, or even perfect, many religious
doctrines have displayed a very different view. Human
nature was regarded as being composed of two hostile
elements, a body and a soul. The soul alone was to be
honoured, while the body was regarded as the vile source
of evils. Such a view led to the flagellations and torturings
of the body which form so strange and so widespread a
phenomenon. The Hindu fakirs who swing themselves on
hooks, the dervishes and Mussulman Assouans who beat
in their skulls with clubs, the Russian Skoptsy who emasculate
themselves, and many other instances make it plain that
natural perfection is not taken as the basis for conduct.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buddha<a id='r18'></a><a href='#f18' class='c014'><sup>[18]</sup></a> in the clearest way showed his belief that
human nature was base. Coming out from the apartments
of the women, there came to him a “vivid idea
of the impurity of the body, a feeling of repulsion from it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>and of blame of it; regarding his own body and seeing
its wretchedness, he began to despise it, and to formulate
conceptions of impurity and purity; <em>from the sole of the
feet to the crown of the head, to the limit of the brain, he saw
that the body was born in impurity, came from impurity, and
always let itself be drawn to impurity</em>.” These reflections
led him to the conclusion: “What wise man, having regarded
his own body, will not see in it an enemy?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Towards the end of the old world, the Greek theory
of human nature yielded to a very different conception.
The opposition between the opinions of the Stoics on
morality, and their admiration of human nature, led Seneca,
one of the last Roman Stoics and a celebrated contemporary
of Jesus Christ, to break completely away from the ancient
doctrine. Convinced of the moral weakness and imperfection
of man, and of the persisting power of evil, Seneca
declared that human nature contained a vicious and essentially
evil element. This element was seated in the body,
which he regarded as so essentially vile that it is to be
despised. Our body was no more than the dwelling of the
soul, its temporary home, a place in which it cannot be
at rest. The body was a burden which the soul would be
rid of, a prison-house from which it would escape. According
to Seneca<a id='r19'></a><a href='#f19' class='c014'><sup>[19]</sup></a> the soul must wrestle with the body, for
the body brings to it nothing but suffering, while the soul is
essentially pure and spotless, and as much above the body
as divinity is above matter.</p>

<p class='c007'>A dualism still more pronounced was characteristic of
the early Christian view of human nature, and led to the
depreciation of the body as compared with the soul. In
the fourth and fifth centuries of our era such a view was
so dominant that a struggle against the material side of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>our nature became a rule of life. The most absolute asceticism
spread throughout the Christian world.<a id='r20'></a><a href='#f20' class='c014'><sup>[20]</sup></a> A struggle
against hunger, thirst, and desire for sleep, rejection of all
pleasures that come from impressions of sight, of hearing,
or of the palate, and, above all, abstention from sexual
intercourse, became, in the opinion of believers, the true
aim of human life. The conviction that human nature
was essentially corrupt led to a declaration of war against
it; all the pleasures were forbidden, even the most innocent
of them being thought vicious. What could be more in
contrast with the calm and joyous philosophy of the Greeks,
for whom there did not exist the idea of a struggle against
the supposed corruption and imperfection of man? The
dualistic theory made such demands on its proselytes that
these, absorbed in the salvation of their souls, sank from
the physical point of view to the level of wild beasts. Hermits
resorted to the lairs of animals, abandoned their clothing
and went about naked with shaggy and disordered hair.
In Mesopotamia and a part of Syria there arose a sect
of eaters of grass; these were people who had no dwellings
and who ate neither bread nor vegetables, but wandered
on the hills and fed on the herbage. Cleanliness of the
body was regarded as an indication of corruptness of the
soul, and among the most highly venerated of the saints
were those who took no care of the body. Athanasius
relates with approval that when St. Antony, the father of
monks, became old he never washed his feet.<a id='r21'></a><a href='#f21' class='c014'><sup>[21]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Such doctrines soon brought about a most serious perversion
of the innate instincts of the human race. The
senses of family and of society became so weakened that
fanatical Christians were more than indifferent to their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>kinsmen and countrymen. One saint was venerated because
he was hard and cruel only to his relatives. It is told
of the Abbot Siseuss that on a believer asking to be received
into the convent, he inquired if the suppliant had any one
akin to him. “I have only a son,” said the Christian.
“Well, then,” said the abbot, “take your son and cast
him into the river, for thus only may you become a monk.”
The father set about to do the bidding of the abbot, and
it was only at the last moment that the order was recalled.
For admission into a Christian community it was necessary
to renounce one’s country.<a id='r22'></a><a href='#f22' class='c014'><sup>[22]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Such ideas have struck a deep and enduring root. In
the opinion of the ministers of the Scotch Church of the
seventeenth century, according to Buckle,<a id='r23'></a><a href='#f23' class='c014'><sup>[23]</sup></a> there was
nothing so surprising as that the earth could contain itself
in the presence of that horrid spectacle, man, and that it
did not gape, as in former days, to swallow him in the
midst of his wickedness. For certainly, in the created
universe, there could be nothing so monstrous and so horrible
as man.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was to be expected that when such conceptions
prevailed, celibacy and repudiation of the reproductive
instinct should have been made obligatory on the clergy.
The words, reported by St. Matthew (xix. 11, 12), that
“there be eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs
for the kingdom of heaven’s sake” were interpreted by
some as implying a voluntary renunciation of marriage,
while others insisted on the literal meaning and in
consequence mutilated themselves more or less completely.
The breasts of women were removed to eradicate the
maternal instincts. But it is only the sect of Skoptsy, by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>no means a small body in Russia, that applies the gospel
command in this stringent fashion. The wish announced by
St. Paul (Corinthians vii. 7), “I say therefore to the unmarried
and widows, it is good for them if they abide even
as I; but if they cannot contain, let them marry, for it is
better to marry than to burn,” soon became a command,
and since the fourth century the Catholic Church has advocated
celibacy of the clergy, although it was not enforced
until the eleventh century (under Gregory VII.). A low
view of human nature has survived in the Catholic Church
even to our own times. Pope Leo XIII., in his “Encyclical
on Freemasons,” proclaimed it.<a id='r24'></a><a href='#f24' class='c014'><sup>[24]</sup></a> “Human nature,”
he said, “was contaminated by the Fall, and as it is therefore
much more prone to vice than to virtue, in order to
attain virtue it is absolutely necessary to restrain the wild
impulses of the soul, and to control the appetites by reason.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Art has reflected the Christian conception of human
nature. Sculpture, which played so great a part in the
ancient world, and which was intimately associated with
Greek ideals, began to decline rapidly in the Christian era.
It lasted longer in the Roman Empire of the East, but in
Italy it was almost completely forgotten by the eighth
century. Painting survived, but not without undergoing
an extraordinary degeneration. All the Italian works of
art of the Carlovingian period, displayed the utmost indifference
to natural form, and a loss of the sense of harmony
and beauty. Later on, Italian art fell lower still. “No
one dreamed any longer of studying nature or of observing
the human body. An epoch in which the interference of
supernatural forces was generally accepted, and in which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>the conception of the universe was founded on a contrast
between the natural and the supernatural, could not admit
in its art the rule of natural law or a natural order of
events.”<a id='r25'></a><a href='#f25' class='c014'><sup>[25]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The intimate connection between the depreciation of
human nature due to Christian doctrine and the inferiority
of the art of the middle ages cannot be denied. Taine<a id='r26'></a><a href='#f26' class='c014'><sup>[26]</sup></a>
writes of the period as follows: “If one considers the
stained-glass windows or the images in the cathedrals, or
the rude paintings, it appears as if the human race had
become degenerate and its blood had been impoverished;
pale saints, distorted martyrs, virgins with flat chests, feet
too long and bony hands, hermits withered and unsubstantial,
Christs that look like crushed and bleeding earthworms,
processions of figures that are wan, and stiffened,
and sad, upon whom are stamped all the deformities of
misery and all the shrinking timidity of the oppressed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The art of the middle ages fell lower and lower until the
Renaissance, with its return to the Greek ideal, brought
new vigour. The great masters of the Renaissance were in
addition scientific men who had studied mathematics and
who employed the technique of mensuration; such were
Alberti, Leonardo da Vinci, Michel Angelo, and others.
The return to the Greek ideals and to nature brought with
it the taste for beauty.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the ancient spirit was born again, its influence
reached science and even religion, and the Reformation
was a defence of human nature. The Lutheran doctrines
resumed the principle of a “development as complete as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>possible, of all the natural powers” of man, and saw in that
ideal a guide for humanity. Compulsory celibacy was
abolished, and free play was given to all the tendencies in
conformity with the laws of nature.<a id='r27'></a><a href='#f27' class='c014'><sup>[27]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Besides those whose religion led them to despise the
human body, there have been many savage races and
tribes who have practised mutilations of the body. It
would be a long list were I to set out all the modes in which
the human body has been disfigured. Treatises on Ethnography
and the volumes of travellers contain a multitude
of details of this sort. The hair, the teeth and the lips have
been subjected to treatment with the object of making
them as unlike the natural condition as is possible. Many
of the lower races discolour their teeth, or remove some of
them, or file them to points. Others insert in the lips
pieces of wood, of stone, or of bone. A whole chapter
might be occupied with an account of the disfiguring
devices of tattooers. The skull, the breasts, and the feet,
have all been subjected to deforming treatment.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although there is not enough evidence to set down these
practices to the existence of definite and self-conscious
religious or philosophic doctrine, it is at least certain that
the people among whom they occur are far from revering
human nature in the fashion of the Greeks, but rather
attempt to distort it in accordance with their own taste.
Discontent with the natural conditions of existence is, as
we have seen, so widespread that there is good reason for
an inquiry as to the existence of some general principle
underlying this diversity of opinion regarding human
nature. I have already shown that this question of human
nature has for long interested mankind, and has shared
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>largely in the formation of ideas of the good and the beautiful.
It is not too soon to submit the problem to rational
investigation, using those rigid methods of science which
have been learned in our epoch. I shall try to give an
exposition of human nature in its strength and in its weakness.
But before passing to man, I shall survey the lower
forms of life, hoping to fix some landmarks that will be
useful in the study of the larger problem.</p>

<p class='c006'>Long before man appeared on the earth animals and
plants were distributed over it. Some of these were endowed
with but vague senses, while others had well-developed
instincts, and some even a certain degree of intelligence
which they applied for their self-preservation and for the
propagation of their own kind.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many species, well adapted for the resistance of external
influences, have survived from very early times to the
present day. In the Carboniferous period birds and mammals
did not yet exist, and the thick forests, with undergrowths
of gigantic ferns, were inhabited by large numbers of articulated
animals, amongst which were scorpions and insects.
The scorpions of that time resemble in every way those
that actually live at the present day in tropical countries;
and amongst the insects of that early epoch were some very
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>like the cockroaches of to-day. Certain tree-like ferns of
the present time are also very similar to those of the coal
period. Amongst the animals the bodies of which are protected
by a shell, such as foraminifera and mollusca,
certain species have survived even from an earlier time than
the coal period.</p>

<p class='c007'>In contrast with this extraordinary survival, there are
instances of the complete disappearance of numbers of
species of animals and plants. In early times, during the
Tertiary epoch, the virgin forests of Europe were inhabited
by a large number of monkeys, of which fossil remains are
now found, especially in Greece. These formerly existed
even in Europe, and some anthropoid apes (<em>Dryopithecus</em>)
have left traces in the tertiary deposits of France.<a id='r28'></a><a href='#f28' class='c014'><sup>[28]</sup></a> These
animals, notwithstanding that their organisation was superior
to that of scorpions and cockroaches, have not been
able to adapt themselves to the altered conditions of modern
Europe. A similar fate has come upon some of the higher
mammals, such as the mammoth and the mastodon.</p>

<p class='c007'>These facts do not bear testimony to the prevalent idea
that there exists in nature a law of universal progress tending
to the production of organisms more and more perfect from
the point of view of complexity of structure. It is incontestable
that forms higher in the scale of life have developed
only after the appearance of lower forms. But it does not
follow that development always takes a progressive march.
Man is one of the later species that have appeared upon
the earth, but there are others of still more recent date.
It is very probable that certain species of lice have appeared
subsequent to man, particularly the clothes-louse (<em>Pediculus
vestimenti</em>). Amongst the true parasites which live only
in the human body are some that have acquired their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>specific characters after the appearance of man. Such are
certain tape-worms and microbes, such as a species of <em>gonococcus</em>.
It is therefore amongst parasites and not to man
that we must look for the latest products of creation.</p>

<p class='c007'>In nature, then, there is no blind tendency towards progress.
Organisms almost innumerable are born every day
with variable characters. Those amongst them which are
adapted to existing circumstances survive and produce offspring
like themselves, but many do not reach maturity, and,
living only for a short time, die without leaving issue.</p>

<p class='c007'>To give the reader a better idea of adaptations and
of their importance to living creatures, it will, perhaps, be
as well to devote some space to an account of examples of
them. Amongst organisms that attract our attention by
their pleasing aspect, there are not many that can rival
flowering plants. Every one admires the great beauty of
the blossom of orchids. There can be no doubt that these
flowers have not been developed to satisfy the æsthetic
tastes of man, for the simple reason that orchids existed for
a long time before man’s appearance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among orchids there is one which, for more than half
a century, has been cultivated by man in many tropical
countries. This is the Vanilla, the fruit of which produces
one of the sweetest of spices.</p>

<p class='c007'>In former days the pods of only the wild vanilla, which
is an undergrowth of the forests of Mexico and South
America, were gathered. But the employment of vanilla
to flavour chocolate has rendered its artificial culture
lucrative; consequently the plant has been transported to
several warm countries where it could be acclimatised. It
has flourished and borne numerous blossoms, but it has
never produced fruit from which alone the aroma is obtained.
As the question of the sterility of the vanilla was of great
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>practical interest to the cultivator, the matter was investigated,
and it was found that the flower remained sterile
because the female and male parts could not come in contact.
The pistils and stamens of the flower are well developed, but
between these sexual organs is a membrane which prevents
fertilisation. After this discovery was made, the idea
occurred that the pollen of the vanilla flower might be
transferred artificially to the stigma of the pistil so as to
bring about “artificial” fertilisation. A young black
slave, Edmond Albius, a native of Réunion, discovered
in 1841 a practical method by which the male and
female elements of the vanilla could be put in contact;
and from this discovery there came a great extension of
the cultivation of the orchid in many countries. At a
certain period a small bamboo point or the tooth of a comb
is introduced into the vanilla flower, and in this way, in
a short time, a quantity of flowers may be fertilised and
so made capable of bearing mature pods.<a id='r29'></a><a href='#f29' class='c014'><sup>[29]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In the original home of the vanilla the intervention of
man is unnecessary. In Guiana and Mexico fertilisation
of the flower is the work of small bees (of the genus <em>Melipona</em>).
They frequent the vanilla flowers to extract nectar,
the material of their honey. Small humming-birds also
hover over the vanilla blossoms, and by introducing their
bills into the sexual organs of the flowers bring about contact
of the male and female elements.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sterility of the vanilla in the countries to which it has
been introduced, before the employment of artificial fecundation,
is easily explained by the fact that in these countries
there are no insects nor humming-birds capable of transporting
the pollen.</p>

<p class='c007'>But it is not only the vanilla that requires the co-operation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>of living beings to produce its fruits. It is the case
with many other orchids. In the flowers of these the pollen
is massed together and cannot be transported by the air.
It needs the aid of insects, as had already been pointed out
by Sprengell in the eighteenth century, and above all by
Darwin, whose splendid investigations are the basis of the
following passages.<a id='r30'></a><a href='#f30' class='c014'><sup>[30]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Insects, belonging to different groups, such as bees,
wasps, flies, certain beetles, and many butterflies and moths,
visit orchids to sip the nectar produced by the plants and
stored in definite parts of the flowers. In order that their
proboscis may reach the stores of sweet juice, the insects
inevitably touch first the upper parts of the flowers, where
the anthers are present. The pollen grains are clustered
in masses, known as pollinia, and these adhere to the body
of the visiting insect by means of an adhesive fluid which
is secreted by an organ of the flower known as the <em>rostellum</em>.
In this way the pollinia adhere firmly, it may be to the
proboscis of butterflies, or to the head or any other part of
the body of insects. They can leave the flower and fly
away without losing the adhering pollinia, and in this
manner they serve as the agents for sexual contact
and for fertilisation of the orchids. Ménière relates that
a person who kept bees near the garden of the Faculté de
Toulouse complained that they returned from the garden
with their heads covered with tiny yellow bodies which he
was unable to clean off from them. It was easy to recognise
in these bodies the pollinia of orchids very firmly
attached to the bees’ heads.<a id='r31'></a><a href='#f31' class='c014'><sup>[31]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>When an insect, bearing these pollinia, introduces itself
into another flower of the same species of orchid, it inevitably
comes in contact with the female apparatus, more
particularly with the viscous surface of the stigma. Some
of the grains of pollen contained in the pollen-mass adhere
to the stigma and are thus enabled to fertilise the ovule.
This carriage of pollen from one flower to another brings
about a crossing which is necessary for the production of
good seed. On the other hand, the seed which is the result
of self-fertilisation of a flower is inferior.</p>

<p class='c007'>An examination of the structure and form of the flowers
of many orchids show that they are adapted in a truly
marvellous way to the visits of insects that convey pollen.
In each part of these flowers one can discern some useful
arrangement to secure cross-fertilisation.</p>

<p class='c007'>For the proper transmission of pollen it is necessary that
the pollinia should adhere very firmly to the body of the
insects, and that the viscous substance which holds them
together should have time to solidify. It is thus of great
advantage to the plant if the insects remain for a considerable
time on the flower. In several orchids the nectar is
not easily accessible, and frequently the insect has to search
for a long time before finding what it desires, and sometimes
it even has to pierce a membranous covering before
reaching the fluid. The operation takes a certain time,
and this is long enough to allow the mucus by which the
pollinia adhere to the insect to set firmly.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the case of orchids the mucus of which sets instantaneously,
there is no reason for the visit of the insect to
be prolonged. In such cases the nectar is easy to extract,
and the insect finds it without loss of time.</p>

<p class='c007'>Darwin, after describing these facts, proceeds to say:<a id='r32'></a><a href='#f32' class='c014'><sup>[32]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>“In these five species” (in which the viscid matter “is
so adhesive that it serves to attach the pollinia firmly to
the insects without getting hard”), “and in these alone, we
find copious nectar ready stored for rapid suction in open
nectaries. On the other hand, whenever the viscid matter
gets hard by exposure for a short time to the air, it would
manifestly be advantageous to the plant if insects were
delayed in obtaining the nectar; and in all such species
the nectar is lodged within intercellular spaces, so that
it can be obtained only by the inner membrane being penetrated
at several points, and this will require time. If
this double relation is accidental, it is a fortunate accident
for the plants; but I cannot believe it to be so, and it
appears to me one of the most wonderful cases of adaptation
which has ever been recorded.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Some orchids secrete instead of nectar a clear liquid like
water. This fluid is collected in a petal inserted at the
lower part of the flower and shaped into a deep cup-shaped
receptacle. It does not attract insects, but by wetting
their wings compels them to leave the flower by a different
exit which passes close to the reproductive organs (<em>i.e.</em>,
the anther and the stigma). The soft linings of the cup
are greedily devoured by certain insects, particularly by
bees. Dr. Cruger, who observed this, has often seen bees
fall into the cup whereupon their wings became so wet as
to prevent their flying away, and they have been obliged
to get out by the channel that carries off the waste from
the reservoir. As the saturated bees creep along the narrow
passage after their involuntary immersion, they come
inevitably in contact with the stigma and the masses of
pollen. The latter adhere to the bodies of the bees and
can be conveyed to the sticky stigma of a neighbouring
flower.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>In other orchids (<em>Catasetum</em>, Fig. 1), the male elements
are discharged by a spring-like arrangement on the body
of insects. When certain parts of the flowers are touched,
the pollinia are thrown off like arrows, which, in the place
of the barbs, have viscid swellings. “The insect, disturbed
by so sharp a blow, or after having eaten its fill, flies sooner
or later away to a female plant and, whilst standing in the
same position as before, the pollen-bearing end of the arrow
is inserted into the stigmatic cavity, and a mass of pollen
is left on its viscid surface.”<a id='r33'></a><a href='#f33' class='c014'><sup>[33]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>After giving detailed descriptions of the cross-fertilisation
of flowers by such peculiar means, Darwin makes the
following remark: “Who would have been bold enough
to have surmised that the propagation of a species depended
on so complex, so apparently artificial, and yet so admirable
an arrangement?”<a id='r34'></a><a href='#f34' class='c014'><sup>[34]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>One orchid (<em>Herminium monorchis</em>, Fig. 2), which bears
very small flowers, is remarkable for the way in which it
is fertilised by insects. Only very small insects are able
to penetrate the flowers. The space being very limited
these minute insects can enter the flower only in a particular
way, and at one of the corners. This causes the pollinia
to become attached always to the same place, which is on
the outer side of one of the two front legs. When the
insect, the carrier of the pollinia, enters a second flower,
it can scarcely fail to fertilise the stigma, which is on the
corresponding side. Darwin said that it would be difficult
to find a case in which there was so marvellously complete
an adaptation to a very peculiar mode of fertilisation as
the little flower of <em>Herminium</em>.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In addition to orchids, there are other flowers the
organisation of which is adapted in a remarkable way to
fertilisation by insects. But to find perfect harmony in
the nature of living beings it is not necessary to confine
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>our observations to flowers. The animal world furnishes us
with numerous examples. To avoid going into the details
of these, I shall content myself with a description of the
most remarkable instances.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every one has seen, flying near the ground, small, slender,
and pretty wasps. From time to time these bury themselves
in the earth or sand, and re-appear in a few minutes.
These are the fossorial wasps, the interesting habits of which
have been studied by Mr. J. H. Fabre, of Avignon. They
are not gregarious, but lead solitary lives and differ in their
habits from their congeners. Bees feed their larvæ with
honey and pollen which they take to them during the whole
period of their development. Wasps are carnivorous,
predatory insects, and bring their spoils to their brood of
soft and feeble larvæ which are unable to provide for
themselves. Bees and most wasps look after the welfare
of their young ones in the fashion of human parents in
nurseries.</p>

<p class='c007'>Fossorial wasps act differently; they never see their
young. They lay their eggs in burrows, sunk in the soil
and hermetically sealed. The larvæ are hatched underground
and are never seen by the mother. Provision
sufficient for their development, however, is made in
advance. Before depositing eggs, the females sink the
burrows, and fill them with the spoils of the chase, which
consist sometimes of spiders and sometimes of crickets or
other insects. Each species of fossorial wasps preys on
a particular kind of insect or on its allies, for the purpose
of provisioning the burrows. These wasps are most fastidious
in the choice of their food, and behave like collectors
whose interest is only in a single or a few species of small
animals. Léon Dufour, the well-known entomologist, was
much struck by the ability displayed by certain wasps
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>(<em>Cerceris</em>, Fig. 3) in seeking out and capturing the pretty
beetles of the genus <em>Buprestis</em>, which he had great difficulty
in finding himself. In making a study of these
beetles he collected the material from the burrows of
<em>Cerceris</em>, and so avoided the laborious task of obtaining
them in the natural state of freedom.
The burrows were filled
with motionless, but perfectly
well preserved, <em>Buprestes</em>. Although
dead Coleoptera dried up
in a short time, those recovered
from the burrows remained in a
good state of preservation for
weeks. Léon Dufour came to the
conclusion that the <em>Cerceris</em> kill
their prey, but inject into them some antiseptic liquid
which perfectly preserves their flesh and intestines.</p>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<img src='images/fig_03.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 3.</span>—<em>Cerceris</em> (after Buffon).</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>J. H. Fabre pursued the study of the habits of fossorial
wasps further. He ascertained that the captured insects
were not dead, but only paralysed. The continuance of the
function of certain organs demonstrated that the <em>Buprestes</em>,
the weevils and other small creatures collected in the burrows
of fossorial wasps, were alive. They could even perform
some slight movements, but they were incapable of locomotion,
and so could not escape. The mechanism of this
paralysis, as far as could be ascertained by Fabre, is one
of the most remarkable phenomena in nature. The fossorial
wasps, guided by their instinct, immediately after
having seized an insect or spider, bury their sting in the
nervous centre which controls the movements of the legs.
When animals with soft bodies, such as spiders and young
crickets, are attacked, the operation does not present any
difficulties. But Coleoptera in general, and the <em>Buprestes</em>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>and weevils in particular, are furnished with a very hard
covering which cannot be perforated by the small and
slender sting of a fossorial wasp. To gain their object the
wasps probe exactly between the first and second pair of
legs in the median line of the under surface of the thorax.
The skin is thinner at this spot, and they introduce their
sting into the ganglia from which arise the nerves of the
legs. In the case with the <em>Buprestes</em> these ganglia are
set close to one another, and a single prick suffices to affect
the nervous centres of three pairs of legs. Once the sting
has been inserted in this way the <em>Buprestis</em> becomes paralysed,
but lives for many days. “The <em>Cerceris</em> which preys
on Coleoptera,” writes Fabre,<a id='r35'></a><a href='#f35' class='c014'><sup>[35]</sup></a> “appears to have made its
choice according to the dictates of an exact physiology and
anatomy. It is impossible to see in its proceedings the
results of happy chance; more than chance is required to
explain adaptations so precise.”</p>

<p class='c007'>After having filled the burrow with a sufficient quantity
of insects or spiders, fossorial wasps lay their eggs and carefully
close up the entrance. In due course the larva is
hatched, and devours the food that it finds close at hand.
If the gathered insects were not paralysed, they could
easily escape from their prison; if they were dead,
putrefaction or desiccation (according to circumstances)
would render them unfit for the larvæ. It is therefore
sheer necessity that is the factor in the development of
this marvellous instinct that induces the fossorial wasps
to attack the nervous centres of their prey. When one
insect has been devoured, the larva proceeds to another,
and so on, until it is fully grown, whereupon it envelops
itself in a case that protects it during the winter and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>following spring. In summer it changes at first into a
chrysalis, and later into a perfect insect. It frees itself from
the cocoon, takes to flight, and enters upon life like that
of its mother, which it has never seen.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the harmonious phenomena in nature it is indeed
difficult to find other examples so perfect as those of the habits
of these fossorial wasps, or of the mechanism for the fertilisation
of orchids. These harmonies in nature are
constantly met with in the world of living beings, and it
is not astonishing that they have for a long time attracted
the attention of many observers and philosophers. As it
seemed impossible to attribute them to the organisms themselves,
because of the low rank and lack of intelligence of
these, it has seemed only natural to set them down as a
manifestation of a superior force which organises and
directs all natural phenomena. This argument, however,
omits one side of the medal.</p>

<p class='c007'>Any close investigation of organisation and life reveals
that, beside many most perfect harmonies, there are facts
which prove the existence of incomplete harmony or even
absolute disharmony. The examination of the flowers of
orchids would lead one to the belief that each part, even the
smallest and apparently most insignificant, has its <em>rôle</em> in
the mechanism for fertilisation and cross-fertilisation. In
reality it is not so. There are in certain orchids organs
which do not fulfil any function.</p>

<p class='c007'>Even among the species of <em>Catasetum</em>, in which the pollinia
are thrown with force on the bodies of insects, there are
some female flowers in which the male organs are rudimentary
and without utility. In these flowers, according to
Darwin,<a id='r36'></a><a href='#f36' class='c014'><sup>[36]</sup></a> “the two membranous sacks containing the
rudimentary pollen-masses never open, but they easily
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>separate from each other and from the anther. The tissue
of which they are formed is thick and pulpy. Like most
rudimentary parts, the pollen-masses vary much in size
and form; they are only about one-tenth of the bulk of
those of the male.” There are then, without doubt, some
structures that are of no service.</p>

<p class='c007'>The existence of these rudimentary pollinia, incapable
of being transported or of fertilising the female element, is
easily explained by the supposition that formerly the
flowers of the <em>Catasetum</em> were true hermaphrodites, but that
in the course of time the male organs have become incompletely
atrophied in certain flowers, in which, on the other
hand, the female part has increased. The occurrence of
an actual degeneration is shown by the existence of rudiments
of the pollinia too insignificant to accomplish their
normal functions.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rudimentary and useless organs are widely distributed,
and we find them in many places. Familiar instances are
the atrophied eyes of animals that live in the dark, and
the sometimes rudimentary sexual organs of many plants
and animals.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not only are orchids and other flowers adapted to fertilisation
by means of insects, but many insects display
special adaptations to their habit of visiting flowers. Butterflies,
bees, and many other insects, possess mouth organs
modified for the purpose of penetrating flowers to secure
nectar or pollen. Other insects, again, are not so fortunate
in this respect. Darwin<a id='r37'></a><a href='#f37' class='c014'><sup>[37]</sup></a> on one occasion “found an
extremely minute Hymenopterous insect vainly struggling
to escape, with its head cemented by the hardened viscid
matter to the crest of the rostellum and to the tips of the
pollinia (of an orchid, <em>Listera ovata</em>, Fig. 4). The insect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>was not so large as one of the pollinia, and after causing the
explosion had not strength enough to remove
them; it was punished for attempting
a work beyond its strength, and
perished miserably.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Many insects, well adapted for the purpose,
delight themselves by sucking the
nectar of flowers. Many others would wish
to do the same, but their want of adaptation
baffles them. A small “lady-bird”
loves the sweet juice of flowers; it tries
often to suck the nectar of the dandelion,
but without success. Hermann Müller<a id='r38'></a><a href='#f38' class='c014'><sup>[38]</sup></a>
has described the behaviour of this insect
in procuring the nectar of <em>Erodium cicutorium</em>.
“The awkward way in which this
beetle, unadapted to feed on the plants,
endeavours to obtain the honey, is too
ludicrous not to be mentioned. After taking
up a position on the petal, it puts its
mouth in the direction of one of the honeycups
which are situated on both sides of
the base of the petal. The petal soon
breaks off, upon which the insect fixes
itself on a neighbouring sepal or falls to
the ground with the petal. In the first
case it proceeds to creep over the flower
and ends by detaching all the petals; in
the other case, on recovering from the
shock, it quickly ascends another stem of
the same plant and begins again. I have
seen the same lady-bird fall four times in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>succession with petals which it had detached without gaining
wisdom.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The instincts of insects, well developed for certain functions,
often present aberrations more or less whimsical and
remarkable. The caterpillars of some butterflies, before
changing into chrysalids, envelop themselves in a wellwoven
cocoon capable of protecting them from noxious
influences. Protected by this covering, the caterpillar
changes into a chrysalid, and later into a butterfly, which
perforates the end of the cocoon in order to emerge. When
any external agency destroys the cocoon, normal metamorphosis
becomes impossible, and the larva dies before
its maturity. Fabre<a id='r39'></a><a href='#f39' class='c014'><sup>[39]</sup></a> questioned whether the caterpillar
during the time of the weaving of the cocoon was capable
of repairing it if it was damaged. For this object he cut
with a pair of scissors the end of a cocoon in the course
of construction by the caterpillar of the beautiful peacock-butterfly.
In spite of the hole thus produced, the caterpillar
continued its ordinary work without suspicion that
it would be of no avail. On this occasion “the caterpillar
of the peacock-butterfly, notwithstanding the certain fate
of the future butterfly, continued peaceably to spin, without
in the least modifying the regular progress of its labour;
when the time had arrived for the putting in of the last
defensive stitches it placed them in the perilous breach,
but neglected to mend the destroyed part of the barricade.
It performed its vain task, ignoring what was indispensable
for success.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Even amongst fossorial wasps, the instincts of which are
so admirably developed, harmony is far from perfect. Fabre
endeavoured to ascertain what effect was produced on these
insects by taking away the egg laid in the burrow. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>chose for this experiment the fossorial wasp <em>Pelopæus</em>
(Fig. 5), which preys on spiders. He took away the egg which
had been deposited in a carefully-prepared burrow, and
watched the subsequent manœuvres. “The <em>Pelopæus</em> continued
to store up spiders for the
stolen egg; it gathered provisions
that were not to be eaten; it
redoubled its efforts to replenish
a larder that I was constantly
robbing with my forceps.” The
insect neither discontinued its
fruitless task nor appeared to be
aware of its fruitlessness. Here,
then, is an example of a foiled
maternal instinct that gained no
useful end.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In connection with such a slaughter for the benefit of a
progeny that will never exist, I may mention observations
relating to a quite different order of phenomena. There
are many creatures that kill and devour their progeny. Not
infrequently rabbits kill and devour all their progeny, or
leave them to die without food or care. Sometimes
the culprits are young rabbits without experience; but
this aberration of instinct is also met with in old rabbits,
which once and for all have contracted the habit of abandoning
or eating their young. Some females of other species
of mammals and of birds have often been surprised in the
act of deserting or of killing their offspring.</p>

<p class='c007'>Perversion of sexual instinct is frequent enough amongst
animals. Huber<a id='r40'></a><a href='#f40' class='c014'><sup>[40]</sup></a> states that when male ants have a lack
of females they ravish the workers, the attacks being fatal,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>as the sexual organs are incompletely developed and
functionally incapable. Abnormal pairing has also been
observed in the stag-beetle of the genus <em>Lucanus</em>, in bees,
and, above all, in cockchafers.<a id='r41'></a><a href='#f41' class='c014'><sup>[41]</sup></a> Higher animals, such as
dogs, furnish analogous examples of sexual perversion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Onanism is well known amongst mammals. It is frequent
among monkeys in menageries, and also in rutting
stags, the latter discharging the seminal fluid by friction
with trees. Stallions and mares have often been observed
in the act of satisfying their sexual appetites by abnormal
means. There are several other species (dogs, bears, chamois,
elephants, parrakeets, etc.,) which resort to onanism.<a id='r42'></a><a href='#f42' class='c014'><sup>[42]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>These disharmonious instincts do not in the least cause
the death of the animals that manifest them. But there
exist in nature instinctive aberrations much more dangerous.
Who has not seen in the summer numerous insects gathered
round lamps and candles, attracted by the light? Among
these are Coleoptera, Neuroptera (<em>Phryganea</em>), Ephemera, and,
most frequently of all, small nocturnal Lepidoptera. After
flying round and round the light several times, they singe
their wings and die in numbers. This instinct is so constant
and so developed amongst many of these insects, that
it has been used against them for their own destruction.
Thus amongst the means advocated for destroying a moth,
<em>Botys sticticalis</em>, the caterpillars of which devour cereals and
beetroot,<a id='r43'></a><a href='#f43' class='c014'><sup>[43]</sup></a> is the lighting of numerous fires in the fields.
The moths, attracted by the light, fall in the flames and
die in quantities.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the usual swarms of may-flies emerge from the
water, fishers make straw fires on their boats, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>insects singe their wings. The innumerable bodies incapable
of flight fall into the water, and provide a coveted
food for the fish.<a id='r44'></a><a href='#f44' class='c014'><sup>[44]</sup></a> This disharmonious and fatal instinct is
displayed chiefly by nocturnal insects that rest during the
day and do not leave their retreats till after sunset. In
the cornfields Coleoptera of the genera <em>Anisoplia</em> and <em>Rhizotrogus</em>,
resembling each other in form and general appearance,
are to be found. When a fire is lighted in the darkness
of the night it is only the <em>Rhizotrogus</em> that approaches it
at the risk of its life. The <em>Anisoplia</em> remains quiet in the
midst of the corn. The latter kind of beetle pairs during
the day, while the <em>Rhizotrogi</em> satisfy their sexual desires
during the night. Moreover, it is the males only of this
species that fly about in the darkness and approach the
fire, whilst the females rest at home in the plants.<a id='r45'></a><a href='#f45' class='c014'><sup>[45]</sup></a> It is
probable, therefore, that light induces a sort of sexual excitement
in these male beetles. The males, searching for the
female, believe her to be in the midst of the flames, towards
which they fly without being conscious of the danger they
incur.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such an interpretation of this disharmonious and suicidal
instinct is confirmed by the fact that the moths attracted
by fire are also almost exclusively males. Moreover, entomologists
have advised against the lighting of fires by agriculturists
in the belief that they destroy the noxious <em>Botys</em>,
as they maintain that the females are not attracted. These
latter therefore live on, and, being capable of laying eggs,
produce a generation of voracious caterpillars.</p>

<p class='c007'>Of the <em>Ephemera</em> attracted by fire in such great quantities
males are by far the more numerous. It is therefore really
very probable that the mad excitement which leads to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>destruction of so many male insects, represents a sort of
sexual aberration. In this connection it is to be remembered
that, amongst Coleoptera, species exist of which the
females, hidden in the grass, produce intense light which
attracts the males. In the common glow-worm, the female,
which is devoid of wings, alone shines with the familiar
greenish glitter. Even in species of which the two sexes
are luminous, the female shines more vividly. It is true
that there are some beetles with luminous larvæ, a fact that
led Darwin<a id='r46'></a><a href='#f46' class='c014'><sup>[46]</sup></a> to remark that the production of light by
insects may serve to frighten enemies. This is possible,
and it is also possible that certain insects make use
of their luminosity to light their way in the darkness.<a id='r47'></a><a href='#f47' class='c014'><sup>[47]</sup></a>
But, notwithstanding this, the sexual character of the
luminous organ is so manifest in certain species that it is
impossible to doubt its function as a means of attracting
the male.</p>

<p class='c007'>In conclusion I may say that it is not my purpose at
present to discuss the meaning of an instinct so fatal to
insect life. I wish only to point out the frequency of the
natural occurrence of disharmony, so that the satisfaction
of an instinct is fatal to so many of its possessors.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is plain that an instinct, or any other form of disharmony
leading to destruction, cannot increase, or even endure
very long. The perversion of the maternal instinct tending
to abandonment of the young is destructive to the stock.
In consequence, individuals affected by it do not have the
opportunity of transmitting the perversion. If all rabbits,
or a majority of them, left their young to die through
neglect, it is evident that the species would soon die out.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>On the contrary, mothers, guided by their instinct to nourish
and foster their offspring, will produce a vigorous generation
capable of transmitting the healthy maternal instinct so
essential for the preservation of the species. For such a
reason harmonious characters are more abundant in nature
than injurious peculiarities. The latter, because they are
injurious to the individual and to the species, cannot perpetuate
themselves indefinitely.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this way there comes about a constant selection of
characters. The useful qualities are handed down and
preserved, while noxious characters perish and so disappear.
Although disharmonies tend to the destruction of a species,
they may themselves disappear without having destroyed
the race in which they occur.</p>

<p class='c007'>This continuous process of natural selection, which offers
so good an explanation of the transmutation and origin of
species by means of preservation of useful and destruction
of harmful characters, was discovered by Darwin and
Wallace, and was established by the splendid researches
of the former of these.</p>

<p class='c007'>Long before the appearance of man on the face of the
earth, there were some happy beings well adapted to their
environment, and some unhappy creatures that followed
disharmonious instincts so as to imperil or to destroy their
lives. Were such creatures capable of reflection and communication,
plainly the fortunate among them, such as
orchids and fossorial wasps, would be on the side of the
optimists; they would declare this the best of all possible
worlds, and insist that, to secure happiness it is necessary
only to follow natural instincts. On the other hand, the
disharmonious creatures, those ill adapted to the conditions
of life, would be pessimistic philosophers. Consider the case
of the lady-bird, driven by hunger and with a preference
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>for honey, which searches for it on flowers and meets
only with failure, or of insects driven by their instincts into
the flames, only to lose their wings and their lives; such
creatures, plainly, would express as their idea of the world
that it was fashioned abominably, and that existence was
a mistake.</p>

<p class='c007'>As for man, the creature most interesting to us, in what
category does he fall? Is he a being whose nature is in
harmony with the conditions in which he has to live, or is
he out of harmony with his environment? A critical
examination is needed to answer these questions, and to
such an examination the pages to follow are devoted.</p>

<p class='c006'>To understand human nature it is necessary first to give
an account of the origin of man. This question has preoccupied
mankind for ages, and for a long time it was
believed that a solution of the problem was to be found in
religious dogmas. Man was regarded as being of supernatural
origin, the result of a special creation. Scientific
criticism has now shown that there are no grounds for such
a conclusion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nearly half a century ago Darwin applied to man his
discovery of the principle of natural selection, and of the
part played by that in the origin and transmutation of
species. Soon after the publication of the “Origin of
Species,” attention was given to the special case of man.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>In 1863 Huxley<a id='r48'></a><a href='#f48' class='c014'><sup>[48]</sup></a> gave an admirable review of the problem
in his work on “Man’s Place in Nature.” He brought
forward arguments of the highest scientific validity in
support of the thesis that man is descended from animals,
and that he is a mammal most nearly related to monkeys,
and among these to the anthropoid apes. In spite of this
masterly exposition, there are still persons of high intelligence
and superior education who declare that science has
not yet answered the question as to whence he came, and
that the theory of evolution will never provide an answer.<a id='r49'></a><a href='#f49' class='c014'><sup>[49]</sup></a>
Close examination of the structure of man has proved, in
the most definite fashion, the existence of a near kinship
with the higher monkeys, or anthropoids. When the chimpanzee
and the ourang-outang were discovered, comparison
became inevitable, and many naturalists, including the great
Linnæus, saw that the human race must find its place in
classification near the anthropoids.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now that all the details of the human organisation have
been studied, and the anatomical structures of man and
large monkeys without tails have been compared, bone
with bone and muscle with muscle, a truly astonishing
analogy between these organisms is made manifest, an analogy
apparent in every detail. It is known that in the natural
history of mammals the teeth play an important part as
a means of determining differences and relationships. The
dentition of man bears a very great resemblance to that
of anthropoids. Every one knows the <em>milk teeth</em> and the
<em>permanent teeth</em> of man. The anthropoid apes bear in this
respect an astonishing likeness to man. The number
(thirty-two in the adult), the form and general arrangement
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>of the crown, are identical in man and anthropoid apes.
The differences are to be found only in minor details, such
as the exact shape and relative dimensions and the number
of cusps. It can be said in a general way that in the anthropoid
apes the teeth are more strongly developed than in
man. The canines are much longer and the roots of the
pre-molars are more complex in the gorilla than in man.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the fact must not be lost sight of, that all these differences
are less pronounced than those which exist between
the dentition of anthropoid apes and that of all other
monkeys. Even in the cynocephalous monkeys, those that
most nearly approach the anthropoids, the teeth exhibit
marked differences. Thus, the forms of the upper molars
are quite different in the baboon and in the gorilla. The
canines are longer, and the pre-molars and molars are still
more complex in the baboon.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the monkeys of the New World, the dentition differs
still more from that of man and anthropoids. Instead of
thirty-two teeth, they possess thirty-six in the adult condition.
The number of pre-molars is twelve instead of
eight. The general form and the crowns of the molars are
very different from those of anthropoid apes.</p>

<p class='c007'>These considerations led Huxley to conclude that “it
is obvious that, greatly as the dentition of the highest ape
differs from that of man, it differs far more widely from that
of the lower and lowest apes.”<a id='r50'></a><a href='#f50' class='c014'><sup>[50]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Another character which shows that anthropoids are
nearer man than other monkeys is furnished by the anatomy
of the sacrum. In monkeys as a whole the sacrum
is composed of three, or rarely four, vertebræ, while in
anthropoid apes it contains five, that is to say just as many
as in man.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>The whole skeleton, and particularly the skull of man, and
the higher monkeys, present certainly some marked differences;
but here again the differences are less than those
between the anthropoid apes and other monkeys. As
regards the osteology the proposition laid down by Huxley
is just. “So that, for the skull, no less than for the skeleton
in general, the proposition holds good, that the differences
between man and the gorilla are of smaller value than those
between the gorilla and some other apes.”<a id='r51'></a><a href='#f51' class='c014'><sup>[51]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The believers in the doctrine that the human species is
essentially distinct from all the known monkeys have laid
great stress on the difference between the foot of man and
that of anthropoid apes. This difference cannot be denied.
Man assumes the direct posture habitually, while monkeys,
even the highest of them, walk on two legs only occasionally.
There has followed from this a greater development
of the feet in monkeys. Yet this difference ought not to
be exaggerated. It has been sought to prove that monkeys
are “quadrumanous,” and that their hind legs terminate
in “hind-hands.” But it is clearly shown that in all essential
respects the hinder limb of the gorilla terminates in as
true a foot as that of man.<a id='r52'></a><a href='#f52' class='c014'><sup>[52]</sup></a> “The hind limb of the gorilla,
therefore, ends in a true foot, with a very movable great
toe. It is a prehensile foot, indeed, but is in no sense a
hand; it is a foot which differs from that of man not in
any fundamental character, but in mere proportions, in
the degree of mobility, and in the secondary arrangement
of its parts.”<a id='r53'></a><a href='#f53' class='c014'><sup>[53]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In all these cases the argument is confirmed, “that be
the differences between the hand and foot of man and those
of the gorilla what they may, the differences between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>those of the gorilla and those of the lower apes are much
greater.”<a id='r54'></a><a href='#f54' class='c014'><sup>[54]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The comparison of muscles and of other internal organs
leads to the same conclusion; the differences between
monkeys are more varied and greater than those between
anthropoids and man. The
anatomy of the brain has
been much discussed with
regard to this. Several
distinguished zoologists,
amongst them Owen in
particular, have insisted
on the absence in all
monkeys of certain parts
of the brain peculiarly
characteristic of man.
Such are the posterior
lobe, the posterior cornu,
and the lesser hippocampus. Controversy on this topic has
been animated; but, ultimately, the opinion of Owen did
not triumph, and now it is unanimously accepted that the
parts of the brain in question are “precisely those structures
which are the most marked cerebral characters common to
man with the apes. They are among the most distinctly
simian peculiarities which the human organism
exhibits.”<a id='r55'></a><a href='#f55' class='c014'><sup>[55]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>As regards the brain, the differences between man and
anthropoid apes are certainly less marked than those that
exist between the higher and lower monkeys.</p>

<p class='c007'>The digestive tract affords another argument in favour
of the affinity of anthropoid apes to man. The human
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>cæcum is furnished with the very remarkable and strange
vermiform appendage which often is the cause of a grave
and prevalent illness known as <em>appendicitis</em>. Now, it is
quite remarkable that this organ is practically identical
with the vermiform appendage of anthropoid apes. A glance
at the accompanying
figures (6 and
7) will convince
the reader of this.
Yet none of the
other monkeys
present any such
resemblance with
man.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It is not surprising,
in the face of
resemblances so
numerous, that forty years’ science has proclaimed the existence
of a close affinity between man and the anthropoid apes.
The view has become an established doctrine, now that
no single fact has been brought against it. Since the
theory was enunciated we have learned much regarding
the natural history of these apes. Generally, when a theory
is false, a new set of facts overthrows it. Attempts may be
made to trim the new facts to the existing theory, but such
attempts are doomed to failure, and the theory disappears. It
is of special interest, then, to confront the simian theory of
the origin of man with a series of facts gathered by science
since the theory was propounded.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Huxley wrote, the embryological history of anthropoid
apes was practically unknown. Darwin, Vogt, and
Haeckel, in their attempts to support the theory of the
animal origin of man, had not sufficient knowledge of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>embryology of monkeys. It is only recently that important
work on this subject has been published.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is known that the history of development is very often
an excellent guide in tracing the relationship of organisms.
It is therefore interesting to examine the established facts
concerning the embryology of anthropoid apes. The
material for these studies is very difficult to obtain, and
it is not astonishing that even our present state of knowledge
is still imperfect.</p>

<p class='c007'>The placenta often gives information of great importance
in the classification of mammals. It is sufficient to glance
at the zonary placenta of dogs and seals to be convinced
of the relationship of these two species, which at first sight
seem so different. Now, the placentas of all the anthropoid
apes examined up to the present are of the same discoid
type as that of man. The arrangement of the umbilical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>cord of man, which was formerly considered as quite peculiar
to him, is found in anthropoid apes, as has been
established by Deniker<a id='r56'></a><a href='#f56' class='c014'><sup>[56]</sup></a> and Selenka<a id='r57'></a><a href='#f57' class='c014'><sup>[57]</sup></a> It is striking
that the anthropoids resemble man rather than the lower
monkeys in the relation of the fœtus to the fœtal membranes.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 9.</span>—Human fœtus of three months and a half.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>With regard to the embryos themselves, the similarity
between those of monkeys and of man is very great. Selenka
insists on the fact that the youngest stages of human development
that have been obtained can hardly be distinguished
from those of the lower monkeys either in position
or in shape. More advanced stages exhibit greater differentiation,
and the later embryos of man resemble those of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>anthropoids much more closely than those of the lower
monkeys. The fœtus of the gibbon, figured by Selenka
(Fig. 8), presents the most striking likeness to a corresponding
human fœtus (Fig. 9).</p>

<p class='c007'>Later on, the characters that distinguish man from even
the highest of the apes become more and more pronounced.
In the anthropoids the facial portion becomes more and more
prominent, and betrays a bestiality absent from the human
form. None the less the resemblance between the nearly
mature fœtus of anthropoids and human embryos of about
the sixth month is evident enough. M. Deniker had the
good fortune to obtain the late fœtus of a gorilla—a very rare
piece of fortune—and he has made an elaborate investigation
of its structure. The general appearance (Fig. 10) is
quite enough to show the close relationship with a human
fœtus of a corresponding age (Fig. 11). It is plain, moreover,
that the young gorilla is more human-like than is the adult.
Detailed anatomical investigation only confirms this conclusion.</p>

<p class='c007'>The skulls of the young stages of anthropoids are much
more human in their character than the adult skulls. Selenka
states that such young skulls of different anthropoids not
only resemble one another more closely, but are more
human. As soon as the teeth begin to appear, the individual
characters are assumed so rapidly, and become so
marked, that, in the absence of the intermediate stages,
it would be difficult to establish the kinships.</p>

<p class='c007'>The data derived from embryology do not point to any
one of the existing genera of monkeys as the ancestor of
man. They lead us to infer, rather, that man and the
anthropoid apes had a common origin, and palæontological
evidence must be scanned to find this ancestor. The greatest
importance has been attached to a discovery in Java, made
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>in 1894 by Eugène Dubois. The remains, consisting of the
crown of a skull, two teeth and a femur, belonging to a
creature for which the name <em>Pithecanthropus erectus</em><a id='r58'></a><a href='#f58' class='c014'><sup>[58]</sup></a> has
been invented, have been interpreted by several anatomists
as those of a form intermediate between man and the
anthropoid apes. However, as the facts about this creature
are meagre and have been interpreted differently, I shall
not make use of them in my argument. Even apart from
them, the simian origin of man may be taken as proved.</p>

<p class='c007'>The series of facts that I have been employing as evidence
of the relationship between men and anthropoid apes has
been drawn from the observations of anatomists and embryologists.
Darwin, seeking to broaden the basis of the argument,
called attention to the resemblances of the parasites
of men and apes, as evidence of a close similarity of physiological
processes in the creatures. In the last few years,
investigations in a very different field seem capable of
throwing a novel light on the question.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the blood of one mammal is injected into the body
of another, the latter shows remarkable modifications.
When there is added to a serum, prepared from the blood
of a rabbit and consisting of a colourless transparent liquid,
a few drops of blood drawn from another rodent (for instance
a guinea-pig), nothing unusual happens. The blood of the
guinea-pig preserves its normal colour, and its corpuscles
remain practically unaltered. If, instead of adding guinea-pig’s
blood to the serum of rabbit’s blood, we add a serum
drawn from the blood of the guinea-pig, still no special
change occurs.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>If, however, a serum be prepared from the blood of a
rabbit into which there had first been injected the blood
of a guinea-pig, the serum shows new and striking qualities.
The addition to it of some drops of guinea-pig’s blood
brings about, in a very short time, a changed appearance.
The red liquid, at first opaque, becomes transparent. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>mixture of the prepared serum of the rabbit with the blood
of the guinea-pig will assume the colour of claret mixed
with water. The change is due to solution of the red
corpuscles of the guinea-pig in the blood serum of the rabbit.</p>

</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>This serum has still another property not less worthy of
attention. If there is added to it not pure blood but only
blood serum of the guinea-pig, a disturbance in the mixture
occurs almost at once, and leads to the forming of a precipitate
more or less abundant.</p>

<p class='c007'>The injection of the blood of the guinea-pig into a rabbit
has therefore changed the serum of the latter by introducing
new properties: that of dissolving the red corpuscles
of the guinea-pig and of giving a precipitate with the blood
serum of the same animal.</p>

<p class='c007'>Frequently the blood serum of animals prepared by previous
injections of the blood of other species of animals is
strictly specific. In such cases the serum only gives a
precipitate with the serum of the species which has furnished
the blood for the injections, and only dissolves the red
corpuscles of this same species. But there are some instances
in which a serum of a prepared animal dissolves, not only
the red corpuscles of the species which has furnished the
injected blood, but those of allied species. Thus the blood
serum of the rabbit, after some injections of blood of the
chicken, becomes capable of dissolving not only the red
corpuscles of the chicken but also those of the pigeon,
although in a less degree.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been suggested that assistance could be rendered
to forensic medicine by making use of this property
of serums, to discover the origin of a certain blood. As
is well known, it is often very important to decide whether
a stain was caused by the blood of man or of another animal.
Until quite recently it was not known how to distinguish
human blood from that of other mammals. Experiments
have been made to discover if the red corpuscles found in
the blood stain could be dissolved by the serum of animals
which had previously been injected with the blood of man.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>In a certain case the human origin of the stain in question
was shown. But it was soon discovered that this method
was not infallible. It is now found that the method of
precipitates gives much more conclusive results. It is done
in this way: Human blood is injected several times into
any animal (rabbit, dog, sheep, horse). Some time afterwards
the animal is bled, and a clear and limpid serum,
quite devoid of corpuscles, is prepared. When there is
added to this serum one or several drops of human serum,
it forms immediately a precipitate which falls to the bottom.
In this way it is discovered whether the prepared serum
is sufficiently active. It then becomes possible to recognise
even dried human blood. A little of such blood is dissolved
in normal salt solution, and placed in a tube containing
the serum of an animal prepared by means of the injections
of human blood. If a precipitate forms in the liquid in a
short time, the fact indicates that the stain is really human
blood. This method is being practised in forensic medicine.</p>

<p class='c007'>This reaction is of great interest to us because it is of
assistance in revealing the relationship between species.
The serum of an animal prepared with the blood of the
fowl gives a precipitate, not only with the serum of the
fowl itself, but also with that of the pigeon; on the other
hand, it remains undisturbed when the serum of mammals
is added. The reaction indicates then that there is a sufficiently
marked degree of relationship between the fowl and
the pigeon. Here is another example: the serum of an
animal prepared with the blood of an ox gives an abundant
precipitate when there is added to it a little blood serum
of the ox, but it does not produce this reaction with the
serum of any of the other mammals, not even with that
of the sheep, stag and deer.<a id='r59'></a><a href='#f59' class='c014'><sup>[59]</sup></a> The relationship between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>the <em>Bovidæ</em> and these other ruminants is then not so close
as that between the fowl and the pigeon.</p>

<p class='c007'>How does the serum of animals which has been injected
with human blood behave? The serum capable of giving a
precipitate with human serum does not produce the same
reaction except with the serum of some monkeys (the small
<em>Papio</em>).<a id='r60'></a><a href='#f60' class='c014'><sup>[60]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Gruenbaum, of Liverpool,<a id='r61'></a><a href='#f61' class='c014'><sup>[61]</sup></a> has been fortunate enough to
procure a considerable quantity of the blood of three large
anthropoid apes—the gorilla, chimpanzee, and ourang-outang.
He has been able to prove that the serum of
animals injected with man’s blood gives a precipitate not
only with this blood but also with that of the above-mentioned
apes. It was impossible for him “to distinguish this
precipitate as regards quality and quantity from that
which is obtained with human blood.”</p>

<p class='c007'>To verify this result, Gruenbaum prepared the serum of
animals injected with the blood of the gorilla, chimpanzee,
and ourang-outang. These three kinds of serum gave precipitates
with the blood of these three apes, and to the same
extent with the blood of man. It is therefore evident that
there exists between the human species and the anthropoid
apes not only a superficial analogy of body and of the
principal organs, but a close blood relationship.</p>

<p class='c007'>Facts of this kind could not be foreseen when the theory
of the simian origin of man was put forward. In spite of
this they have arisen to confirm it in a truly astonishing
way.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is therefore impossible to doubt that man is a member
of the group of primates having a close connection with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>higher monkeys of the present time. This result is of great
importance in all questions relating to human nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>It would certainly be of considerable interest to know
more exactly what steps were followed in this simian descent
of man. On this question our knowledge is still very imperfect.
In his researches on anthropoid apes, Selenka insists
on a more intimate relationship between the chimpanzee
and man. “The great resemblance of the pre-molars and
of the molars in the permanent dentition of the chimpanzee
with human teeth appears to indicate that the chimpanzee
and man have a common origin, and descend from extinct
forms like <em>Dryopithecus</em>. This conclusion, however, is contradicted
by the fact that the milk teeth of the chimpanzee
are much nearer those of the ourang-outang than those of
man.”<a id='r62'></a><a href='#f62' class='c014'><sup>[62]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It is evident that to clear up this question it would be
necessary to have a greater knowledge of fossil anthropoids
such as <em>Dryopithecus</em> and its allies. In the present state
of knowledge only a very general hypothesis can be formulated
as to the exact mode of human descent.</p>

<p class='c007'>We have already shown that the fœtus of man and of
the anthropoid monkeys resemble each other much more
than the adult forms, and that the young of these apes also
bear a greater likeness to man than do the adults. The great
development of the skull as compared with the face is
characteristic of young monkeys and of man young or old.
The jaws continue to develop in the anthropoids, while in
man there occurs in this respect a certain arrest of development.
The hairs, so small in man, also show a similar
arrest. Generally they remain during the whole life in a
state of incomplete development. It is especially on the
back of man that this feeble development of hairs occurs.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>As this part of the body in monkeys, on the contrary, is
much more hairy than the under surface, it has been held
to constitute an essential difference between man and
monkeys. But embryological study enables us to settle
this apparent contradiction. The fœtus of the gorilla examined
by M. Deniker possessed an almost entirely smooth
back. “The fœtus had true hairs only on the head, the
anterior surface, and around the lips and the genital organs,
and the eyelashes and eyebrows. The remainder of the
body was smooth or covered with down not exceeding a
millimetre in length.”<a id='r63'></a><a href='#f63' class='c014'><sup>[63]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The skin of the under surface, smooth around the navel,
was covered with small hairs more thickly than on the back.
The abundance of hairs on the posterior aspect of the body
of monkeys is a later acquisition, which develops but tardily
during fœtal life.</p>

<p class='c007'>As regards the distribution of these hairs man resembles
much more the embryos of monkeys than adult monkeys.
This fact, instead of shaking the theory of relationship
between man and apes, gives us strong evidence as to the
mode of his descent. Putting the known facts together,
we may infer that man is a case of the arrested development
of some simian of ancient days, as it were, a simian
monster from the zoological point of view, although not
from the æsthetic. Man may be regarded as a prodigy
sprung from an ape, born with a larger brain and an intelligence
more highly developed than occurred in his parents.
Such a view is in accordance with known facts.</p>

<p class='c007'>It must be admitted that certain kinds of organisms,
instead of evolving at a very slow pace, spring up suddenly,
and that in such a case nature proceeds with a considerable
stride. Darwin foresaw this possibility, but it has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>made plain to us by the remarkable researches of the
botanist Hugo de Vries.<a id='r64'></a><a href='#f64' class='c014'><sup>[64]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>De Vries cultivated for fifteen years the Evening Primrose,
a plant of American origin (<em>Œnothera lamarckiana</em>).
He obtained, suddenly, a set of flowers quite distinct
from those of the original plant. They presented such
great differences that he could separate them as several
quite distinct species. During the first few years De Vries
obtained three species (<em>Œnotera lata</em>, <em>Œn. nanella</em>, and
sometimes <em>Œn. scintillans</em>), but variation becoming more
and more prevalent, he ultimately distinguished a dozen
new species. These were grown from seed, and transmitted
their specific characters to their descendants. De Vries,
in this way, was a witness of the sudden appearance of
new species.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is probable that man owes his origin to a similar phenomenon.
Some anthropoid ape having at a certain period
become varied in specific characters, produced offspring
endowed with new properties. The brain, of abnormal
size, placed in a spacious cranium, allowed a rapid development
of intellectual faculties much more advanced than
those of the parent and those of the original species. This
peculiarity would be transmitted to the descendants, and,
as it was of very considerable advantage in the struggle
for existence, the new race would hold its own, propagate
and prevail. The extraordinary development of intelligence
necessarily led to perfections in the choice of nourishment,
perfections which approached the art of preparing
more digestible food. The jaws, under these conditions,
had not such a difficult task as before, and, moreover, they
were no longer required for attack or defence. They
became less developed than in the true anthropoid apes.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>These suggestions involve a conception of the mind that
is in harmony with known facts. From time to time prodigies
are born with some talent far greater than the
gifts possessed by the parents.</p>

<p class='c007'>About twelve years ago a young native of Piedmont,
Jacques Inaudi by name, became famous in Paris on account
of his extraordinary power of calculation. He had an
astonishing memory for figures, and could perform mathematical
calculations with surprising rapidity.<a id='r65'></a><a href='#f65' class='c014'><sup>[65]</sup></a> Two
minutes were sufficient for him to multiply two numbers
composed of seven and six figures. Other arithmetical
calculations, such as the extraction of roots, gave him but
little trouble.</p>

<p class='c007'>To attain this result, Inaudi made use of his extraordinary
memory for figures, founded on the persistence of auditory
images. When he heard the numbers pronounced, he
remembered them. Inaudi declared to the Commission
convened by the Academy of Sciences, that when he tried
to recall the numbers he heard them as if repeated aloud,
in the tone of his own voice, and that he could hear them
for the greater part of the day. “In an hour, or in two
hours’ time, if I thought of the number that was uttered, I
should be able to repeat it as exactly as I have done before
the Commission.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Now this very extraordinary and rare auditory memory
was developed in an altogether abrupt way. Inaudi, the
son of poor peasants of Piedmont, passed the first years
of his life as a shepherd. At the age of six his wonderful
faculty of calculating figures appeared. He did not know
at this time how to read or to write. At eleven years of
age he astonished the members of the Anthropological
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>Society of Paris by his phenomenal memory, and it was
only much later, at the age of twenty, that he learnt to
read and write. Neither of the parents of Inaudi had shown
in the slightest degree a calculating faculty like that of little
Jacques. It must then be admitted that it was developed as
suddenly as the new qualities in the Evening Primrose that
we have already mentioned.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first men, also, were probably ingenious children,
born of anthropoid parents. This hypothesis very well
explains the fact that man is more like the fœtus and the
young of anthropoid apes than the adult animals, and
exhibits only a trace of many organs which are much more
developed in simian species.</p>

<p class='c007'>A very distinguished German anatomist, Wiedersheim,<a id='r66'></a><a href='#f66' class='c014'><sup>[66]</sup></a>
has given in a pamphlet a <em>resumé</em> of our actual knowledge
of the organs of man from the point of view of their descent.
He has found fifteen organs which show in the human
species a considerable advance on those of anthropoid apes.
The chief of these are the lower limb, well adapted for a
constant erect carriage of the body; the strengthening of
the pelvis and of the sacrum, as well as the broadening of
the more slender pelvis of the female; the curvature of the
lumbar part of the vertebral column; the development of
the buttocks and of the calves; the difference of certain
muscles of the face; the nose; certain strands from the
brain to the spinal cord; the occipital lobe of the brain;
the greater development of the cerebral cortex, and, lastly,
the considerable differentiation of the muscles of the larynx
which permit speech.</p>

<p class='c007'>But besides these progressive organs, Wiedersheim has
counted seventeen decaying organs, still able to fulfil
their physiological function in a more or less incomplete
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>manner (amongst these are the decadent muscles of the
leg and foot; the eleventh and twelfth pairs of ribs,
the toes, the cæcum, etc.), and not less than one hundred
and seven rudimentary organs which serve no useful physiological
purpose (to this category belong the coccyx—the
vestige of a tail—the thirteenth pair of ribs in the adult,
the muscles of the ear, the vermiform appendage, etc.).</p>

<p class='c007'>We have already shown in the preceding chapter the
great importance of rudimentary organs as aids to the
tracing of the genealogy of organisms. These organs, useless
at present, are the vestiges of similar but more developed
organs, which fulfilled a useful function in our ancestors.</p>

<p class='c007'>The extraordinary quantity of rudimentary organs in
man furnishes another proof of his animal origin, and puts
at the disposal of science information of great value for the
philosophic conception of human nature.</p>

<p class='c006'>Although he is a recent arrival on the earth, man has made
great progress as compared with his ancestors, the anthropoid
apes. A comparison between even the lower races
of man, such as the Hottentots or the aborigines of Australia
and higher types such as the inhabitants of Europe
and of North Africa, shows that a very great advance has
been made.</p>

<p class='c007'>Human art has been able to surpass nature in many
instances. No natural sound is so perfect as some of the
more beautiful pieces of modern music. Even in the production
of form, man has triumphed over nature. Breeders
of flowers or of birds seek to produce new varieties. With
this object they often frame a conception of what they desire
to produce, and, so to speak, set about to realise their programme.
They prepare ideal images to serve them as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>guides in the process of production. By the method of
artificial selection they often succeed in their wishes, and
add to their collections some remarkable form. In such
fashions aviculture and horticulture have produced birds
and flowers more beautiful than any found in nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>In regard to the human body, attempts have been made
to surpass nature and to represent a body corresponding
to an artistic ideal. To arrive at something more beautiful
than man, the wings of birds or the characters of some
other creatures have been added to his presentment. Such
attempts have had no other result than to show that the
human form, as created by nature, cannot be surpassed.
The ancient conception of the human body as the artistic
ideal has been fully justified. The views of those religious
fanatics who have thrown contempt on the body by representing
it in degraded forms, must be rejected.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is impossible, however, to apply this result to our conception
of the nature of man in general. The beautiful
form of the human body appears only in youth and in
maturity. In old age, the bodies of men and women are
generally ugly, and in extreme old age it is almost impossible
to see the traces of former beauty.</p>

<p class='c007'>Nor can conceptions of perfection drawn from the human
face and body be extended to the whole of man’s organisation.
A glance at some of the organic systems will make
this plain.</p>

<p class='c007'>The human skin is covered with little hairs, the history
of which is interesting. In one stage of embryonic life nearly
the whole of the body is clad with hairs. This covering
is known as the <em>lanugo</em>, and consists of strands of hair, disposed
very regularly all over the body, save on the nose and
the hands and feet. There is no doubt but that this is
functionless, and is no more than an inheritance from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>old ape-like condition. Later on, it falls out and is replaced
by the ordinary downy covering of the body. In adult life,
and particularly in old age, the hairs of the second coat
tend to grow very long and so to form a covering that is
neither beautiful nor in the least degree useful. We may
take this as a first example of a disharmonious condition in
the human body. Hairs, incapable of protecting the body
from cold, survive merely as an ancestral relic and may
become even harmful.</p>

<p class='c007'>The human skin is constantly exposed to the microbes in
dust; and the follicles of the hairs, in which these microbes
lodge, form receptacles very favourable to their multiplication.
In the hollows of the follicles, certain microbes,
as for instance some of the <em>Staphylococci</em>, multiply rapidly
and give rise to acne and to pimples. The process may
even go the length of producing a chronic skin-disease very
unpleasant and even dangerous if it be associated with
suppuration.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the human race, intelligence, that is to say, the activity
of the brain, supplants many other functions, and man is
able to protect himself against the inclemencies of weather
much better than his furry ancestors were capable of doing.
He is able to do this through his invention of clothing which
may be varied with the nature of the weather. But the
obstinate laws of inheritance burden him with a covering of
hair, not only useless but frequently harmful. And this is
only one example among many.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although, in an extreme case, man is able to survive
the total loss of the teeth, it cannot yet be said that teeth
are useless or harmful. None the less, a study of the human
dentition reveals that this set of organs is out of harmony
with the fundamental needs of our race. The monkeys of
the old world (<em>Catarrhines</em>), although they belong obviously
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>to the brute creation, already exhibit a tendency to
reduction in the number of teeth. While American monkeys
(<em>Platyrrhines</em>) may possess thirty-six teeth, the old world
forms do not possess more than thirty-two in all, at least
as a normal occurrence. Selenka<a id='r67'></a><a href='#f67' class='c014'><sup>[67]</sup></a> has shown that among
gorillas and ourangs individuals with a fourth pair of molars,
bringing up the number of teeth to thirty-six, are not rare.
He found these additional molars in 20 per cent. of one
hundred and ninety-four adult skulls of ourangs. On the
other hand, in the cases of the chimpanzee and the gibbon,
the third pair of molars differ from the others in smaller
size and occasional absence. This reduction is to be associated
with the smaller jaws and less powerful mastication
of these anthropoids.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cases of supplementary molars are very rare in man, and
occur more frequently in the lower races, such as negroes,
Australians, and natives of New Caledonia.<a id='r68'></a><a href='#f68' class='c014'><sup>[68]</sup></a> On the other
hand, absence of the third pair of molars, that is to say,
of the wisdom teeth, is quite frequent, especially in the
white races. Nearly 10 per cent. of Europeans throughout
their lives have no more than twenty-eight teeth, the wisdom
teeth being absent. This absence is more common in the
upper jaw, where it occurs in from 18 to 19 per cent. of
men. The loss of the wisdom teeth<a id='r69'></a><a href='#f69' class='c014'><sup>[69]</sup></a> is on the whole to be
regarded as an advantage. Certainly from the “physiological
point of view the part played by the wisdom teeth
is subordinate. Their power of masticating is feeble; the
loss does not appreciably interfere with mastication. The
complete absence of all four has no influence on mastication.”<a id='r70'></a><a href='#f70' class='c014'><sup>[70]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>These teeth are cut very late, often not appearing
until the thirtieth year and sometimes being delayed to
extreme old age.</p>

<p class='c007'>Even if they were only useless, the wisdom teeth would
furnish an instance of disharmony in the human body. But
these teeth often are a source of trouble which, although
it is not often serious, may lead to grave diseases and even
to death. No other teeth are so subject to accident. This
is due partly to the slowness with which they develop and
to the difficulty they encounter in cutting the mucous
membrane. Dental caries, moreover, is specially frequent
in them.<a id='r71'></a><a href='#f71' class='c014'><sup>[71]</sup></a> The membrane surrounding them is specially
subject to small lesions by which the infection spreads to
adjacent parts. Inflammatory conditions frequently arise
from these teeth, and tumours, caries of the jaw-bone and
even diffused suppuration, leading to death, may be sequelæ
of wounds of the wisdom teeth. Galippe<a id='r72'></a><a href='#f72' class='c014'><sup>[72]</sup></a> has described
a case in which one of these teeth, failing to cut the gum
in the normal position, made its way through the cheek.
This produced an inflammatory suppuration of the cheek
with numerous fistulæ and an inflammation of the masseter
muscle which made it impossible for the mouth to open.
Notwithstanding the extraction of the wisdom tooth that
had been the cause of all these troubles, the patient died
of meningitis, which had started from the tooth. Other
cases have been described in which a difficult eruption of
the tooth led to formation of an abscess in the bone, from
which there arose a fatal abscess of the brain.</p>

<p class='c007'>Wisdom teeth may be the starting-point even of cancerous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>tumours. Magitot<a id='r73'></a><a href='#f73' class='c014'><sup>[73]</sup></a> writes that very many neoplasms of
the jaw may be traced to a source of origin in the socket of
the wisdom tooth.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is no useful function of these teeth to set against
their disadvantages. It was our remote ancestors, masticating
hard food, that had the advantages of these additional
teeth. In man they are rudimentary organs, and provide
another proof of our simian origin.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cæcal or vermiform appendage is another rudimentary
organ in the human body, and is interesting from many
points of view. I have already referred to its importance
as definite evidence of our origin from lower animals, and
shown how striking is the resemblance of the human organ
to that of the anthropoid apes. It consists of a thick wall,
containing glands, a muscular layer and lymphoid clumps.
That it performs no function useful to man is made clear
by the existence of undisturbed health in persons from whom
it has been removed. Thanks to the advances of modern
surgery, this organ has been removed very often, and sometimes
even in cases where it did not appear to have been
diseased. In a great majority of the cases, the removal
of the organ succeeded well, and the patients experienced
no harm, but appeared to carry on all the processes of
digestion with equal completeness.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the other hand, the cæcal appendage in man is frequently
obliterated, there being no trace of the normal
aperture, so that there is no connection between it and the
general digestive cavity. According to Ribbert,<a id='r74'></a><a href='#f74' class='c014'><sup>[74]</sup></a> nearly
one person in four possesses the appendage in an obliterated
condition, the condition being particularly frequent in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>aged. In young persons and infants the aperture of the
appendage is usually open. In cases where there is no communication
with the cavity of the digestive tract, the processes
of digestion appear to be normal. It is logical to
conclude that in the human being the function of the cæcum
is either absent or very slight.</p>

<p class='c007'>Even in the anthropoid apes the appendage of the cæcum
appears to be a rudimentary structure, with a function at
most accessory to that of the lymphoid clumps. In lower
old world monkeys the vermiform appendage does not usually
exist, cases such as that of <em>Cercopithecus sabaeus</em>, in which
it is present as a little boss, being rare. It is necessary to
seek the purpose of this structure still lower in the scale
of life. In some herbivorous creatures the cæcum is large,
and ends in a portion richly provided with lymphoid tissue,
and similar to the vermiform appendage. The rabbit and
certain marsupials are good examples. Undoubtedly, in
their cases, the portion of the digestive canal which corresponds
to the vermiform appendage of man is active in the
digestion of vegetable matter. The organ is a very old
part of the constitution of mammals, and it is because it
has been preserved long after its function has disappeared
that we find it occurring in the body of man.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rudimentary organs for the most part display a congenital
lack of the power of resistance, and, as Darwin
suggested, for this reason they are frequently the seats of
disease. When Darwin wrote his work on the “Descent of
Man,” more than a quarter of a century ago, many fatal
cases of inflammation of the appendage had not been recorded.
Darwin quoted only two cases as known to him. Since
then, appendicitis (the name given by American surgeons
to the first acute or to the chronic inflammation of the
appendage) has become a well-known disease in Europe and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>America, and occupies considerable space in treatises on the
pathology of the digestive tract.</p>

<p class='c007'>To give an idea of the prevalence of appendicitis, I may
mention that in a single Paris hospital (Hôpital Trousseau)
four hundred and forty-three cases of the disease have been
treated in the five years 1895–1899.<a id='r75'></a><a href='#f75' class='c014'><sup>[75]</sup></a> In many of these
cases the subjects were infants, as these as a rule are much
more subject to appendicitis than are the aged. According
to Treves,<a id='r76'></a><a href='#f76' class='c014'><sup>[76]</sup></a> the well-known English surgeon, 36 per cent.
of the observed cases were under twenty years of age. Among
old men, on the other hand, appendicitis is a rare exception.
The varying incidence of the disease at different ages no
doubt depends on the fact that in old age the appendage
is often obliterated. The more easy communication with
the other portion of the gut may be, the more chance
there is for inflammation to occur. As it has a muscular
layer, the appendage is able to void its fœcal contents; and
a Scotch surgeon, Parker Syms,<a id='r77'></a><a href='#f77' class='c014'><sup>[77]</sup></a> has seen an appendage that
he had removed, in the act of writhing about like an earthworm.
Such movements, undoubtedly, would aid the discharge
of the contents of the cavity.</p>

<p class='c007'>The movements of the appendage, however, are usually
feeble, and thus stagnation of the contents is common.
Foreign matter is often found in the cavity, such as the
pips of fruit, seeds, hairs, thorns, and in rare cases pins or
even tin-tacks. Such bodies are capable of wounding the
inner wall of the appendage, and so giving an opportunity
to the microbes that abound in the digestive tube, with the
result that microbial infection and inflammation of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>organ is produced. Often, too, intestinal worms pass into
the appendage and become the carriers of pathogenic
organisms.</p>

<p class='c007'>Appendicitis is usually a grave disease, and is fatal in
from 8 to 10 per cent. of cases. It would be difficult to
find anywhere else in the human body so flagrant a case
of natural disharmony. The organ in question may be
obliterated or removed without disturbance of function,
and, moreover, in its normal condition is a frequent cause
of serious illness!</p>

<p class='c007'>The vermiform appendage is not the only part of the
digestive canal that is out of harmony with the maintenance
of life and health. The cæcum itself, of which the
appendage is only a portion, is degenerating in the human
body, as I stated in the last chapter. The human cæcum,
in fact, is very little developed in comparison with
the cæcum of most herbivorous animals, in which it is a
true organ of digestion. In the human embryo the cæcum
and the appendage are relatively better developed than they
are in the adult.</p>

<p class='c007'>Disharmony is exhibited in the human body not only
by rudimentary organs such as the wisdom teeth and the
appendage, or by degenerating organs such as the cæcum.
Some very large parts of our alimentary canal must be
regarded as useless inheritances, bequeathed to us by our
animal ancestors. It is no longer rash to say that not only
the rudimentary appendage and the cæcum but the whole
of the large intestine are superfluous, and that their
removal would be attended with happy results. So far as
digestion goes, the latter portion of the alimentary tract is
of little importance. Even from the point of view of absorption
of the products of digestion its importance is strictly
secondary. And so it is not astonishing to find that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>removal or disappearance of nearly the whole of the large
intestine can be supported well by man.</p>

<p class='c007'>As one result of the astonishing progress of surgery, it
has been found possible to excise certain parts of the gut,
and particularly of the large intestine. Thus, in one case,
Körte<a id='r78'></a><a href='#f78' class='c014'><sup>[78]</sup></a> removed, along with part of the small intestine,
a considerable part of the large intestine, leaving in place
only the terminal portion. The patient, who underwent
eight successive abdominal operations, recovered. In the
case<a id='r79'></a><a href='#f79' class='c014'><sup>[79]</sup></a> of another patient, operated on by Wiesinger, two
coils of the large intestine (the transverse and descending
colons) which were ulcerated, were isolated from the remainder
of the gut, while the upper portion of the large
intestine (the cæcum and the ascending colon) was sutured
to the rectum. In spite of these serious interferences with
natural structure, the patients recovered, and appeared to
derive great advantage from the loss of the large intestine.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have quoted only two out of many similar cases. However,
apart from surgical evidence, there exists proof of the
uselessness of the large intestine in man. The best argument
in favour of the proposition may be drawn from the
case of a woman who for thirty-seven years discharged
the waste matter from the alimentary canal through an
intestinal fistula. The latter had opened spontaneously, as
the result of an abscess seated on the right side of the abdomen.
Her complaint, however, had not prevented her from
marrying, from bearing three children, nor from pursuing
an arduous calling. The person in question, who was a
workwoman in Varsovie, was examined by a surgeon, M.
Ciechomski,<a id='r80'></a><a href='#f80' class='c014'><sup>[80]</sup></a> thirty-five years after the establishment of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>the fistula. The surgeon proposed to operate, hoping to
restore her to the normal condition, and the woman consented.
However, when the abdominal cavity was opened,
it appeared that the large intestine had atrophied along the
whole length, from the cæcum to the rectum; the inner
orifice of the fistula had passed into the digestive tract
above the cæcum, opening into the small intestine. In the
circumstances it was impossible to close the fistula, and the
surgeon had to close up the abdominal wall, leaving the
patient in her former condition. The woman recovered
rapidly, and continued her usual mode of life. She came
under observation again two years later, but since then had
been lost sight of. The fact that a human being was capable
of carrying on an apparently normal life for thirty years
in the absence of a large intestine is good proof that the
organ in question is not necessary to man, although it has
not yet become rudimentary. In this case again, to find
the useful stage of the structure, we have to go to our
remote ancestors.</p>

<p class='c007'>The large intestine is much better developed in most
herbivorous mammals than it is in carnivorous forms.
Although it is useless in the digestion of animal food, it has
an undisputed importance in the digestion of vegetable
matter. It has a very large calibre in herbivorous creatures,
and the voluminous cavity contains quantities of microbes
which are able to digest cellulose. As cellulose is a material
that resists the ordinary processes of digestion, it is easy
to see the advantage derived from the harbouring of the
microbes. It is more than probable that in the horse, the
rabbit, and in some other mammals, that live exclusively
on grain and herbage, the large intestine is necessary for
normal life.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the other hand, the large intestine discharges a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>function similar to that of the urinary bladder. The urine,
which is being secreted continuously by the kidneys, accumulates
in the large reservoir provided by the bladder.
Similarly the waste matter from the processes of digestion
accumulate in the large intestine and remain there for a
longer or shorter period.</p>

<p class='c007'>In studying the natural history of the large intestine,
it striking that this portion of the gut is well developed only
among mammals. These animals, for the most part, lead
an extremely active terrestrial life. Most of them have to
move about very quickly, the predacious forms in pursuit
of their prey, the herbivorous forms to escape from their
enemies. In such a mode of life, the need to stop in order
to empty the intestines would be a serious disadvantage,
and the possibility of retaining the dejecta in a large reservoir
would be very useful.<a id='r81'></a><a href='#f81' class='c014'><sup>[81]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Such are the causes that have determined the growth of
the large intestine among mammals. Birds, which live,
so to speak, in the air, and which do not need to arrest their
locomotion in order to void their excreta, have no large
intestine. Reptiles and amphibia, although they live a
terrestrial life, do not require a voluminous large intestine,
and such is not found among them. These animals do not
have a fixed temperature; they are what we know as “cold-blooded,”
and in consequence are small eaters. Most of
them are sluggish, and do not lead an active existence like
that of mammals.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the legacy acquired by man from his animal ancestors,
there occur not only rudimentary organs that are useless or
harmful, but fully developed organs equally useless. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>large intestine must be regarded as one of the organs possessed
by man and yet harmful to his health and his life. The
large intestine is the reservoir of the waste of the digestive
processes, and this waste stagnates long enough to putrefy.
The products of putrefaction are harmful. When fæcal
matter is allowed to remain in the intestine, as in cases of
constipation, a common complaint, certain products are
absorbed by the organism and produce poisoning, often of
a serious nature. Every one knows that a high temperature
may be the result of constipation in women after childbirth,
or in patients recovering from an operation. This
is due to an absorption of substances produced by the
microbes of the large intestine. Similar products may be
the cause of an attack of acne or of other skin diseases.
In fine, the presence of a large intestine in the human
body is the cause of a series of misfortunes. The organ
is the seat of many grave diseases, among which dysentery
is notable. In some tropical climates dysentery is a
serious scourge. According to Rhey,<a id='r82'></a><a href='#f82' class='c014'><sup>[82]</sup></a> it is “the greatest
danger to which a European is subjected in Tonkin.
It is responsible for more than 30 per cent. of the
deaths caused by disease.” European troops pay it a
large annual toll in the colonies of the French and
English.</p>

<p class='c007'>Malignant tumours seem to display a predilection for this
region of the digestive tract. Thus, among 1148 cases of
cancer of the alimentary tract recorded in the Prussian
hospitals in 1895 and 1896, 1022, or 89 per cent., affected
the large intestine, including the rectum and cæcum.<a id='r83'></a><a href='#f83' class='c014'><sup>[83]</sup></a> The
small intestine is the only part of the digestive tract
that is indispensable, and it is attacked to a much smaller
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>extent, providing only 11 per cent. of the cases of intestinal
cancer. The probable explanation of these facts is that
the contents of the gut remain in the small intestine a
shorter time than in the large.</p>

<p class='c007'>Stagnation is a familiar cause of disease, and is the probable
cause of the frequency of cancer of the stomach. Of
10,537 cases of cancer of all parts of the digestive tract
recorded in the Prussian hospitals in the same period, 4288,
or more than 40 per cent., affected the stomach. The latter
organ is one that the human body would do well to be rid of.
It is not so useless as the large intestine, since it is the chief
seat of digestion of albuminous substances, but the small
intestine could take its place. Moreover, cases are known
in which surgeons have removed cancerous stomachs.
The results of such operations were favourable, to the extent
that the patients survived and were able to absorb
sufficient nourishment. They had to eat rather more
frequently, and performed the processes of digestion
by means of the secretions of the small intestine and
pancreas.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not surprising to find so many instances of useless
or harmful organs in the alimentary tract. Our ancestors
were creatures that fed on crude and rough materials,
such as wild plants and unprepared flesh. Man has learned
to cultivate plants that are digested easily, and to prepare
his meats in such a fashion as to be readily digested. The
organs that were adapted to the mode of life of the animal
predecessors of man have become to a large extent superfluous.
Many creatures that have found the opportunity
of obtaining their nutriment in a highly digestible condition
have lost, more or less completely, the digestive organs.
Many parasites are instances of this, as for example the
tape-worms, which live in the human digestive tract, bathed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>by a nutritive fluid which they absorb directly; they have
lost the digestive tract completely.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the case of man such an evolution has not occurred,
and there remains in the body a harmful organ like the
large intestine. In consequence, it is impossible for him
to take his nutriment in the most perfect form. If he were
only to eat substances that could be almost completely
absorbed, the large intestine would be unable to empty
itself, and serious complications would be produced. A
satisfactory system of diet has to make allowance for this,
and in consequence of the structure of the alimentary canal,
has to include in the food bulky and indigestible materials
such as vegetables.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this point I may refer to a topic of considerable general
interest. Animals, in the choice of food for themselves or
for their young, are guided by a blind and innate instinct.
As I have shown in my second chapter, creatures like the
fossorial wasps select only particular species of spiders or
insects. Instinct directs them to the kind of food best
suited to the wants of their progeny. Bees are attracted
by the sweet juices of flowers; the silkworm instinctively
devours the leaves of the mulberry and rejects most
other plants. In higher animals, instinct plays the chief
part in the choice of food. The difficulty of getting rats
to eat poisoned food is well known; an instinct warns
them of the danger of the material offered to them.
In the same way dogs refrain from food that has been
poisoned.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every one has seen the minute attention bestowed by a
monkey on food before beginning to eat it. It turns over
what is offered, smells it carefully, cleans it, and before
beginning to eat, subjects it to an examination that seems
to us ridiculous. Monkeys often throw away food without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>even biting it. None the less, in spite of an instinct so
highly developed, monkeys poison themselves with all sorts
of dangerous substances, even when these exhale a strange
odour. I have seen monkeys die poisoned by the phosphorus
of matches, or even by iodoform which they had
contrived to steal.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the case of man, aberrations of instinct in the choice
of food are common. As soon as babies begin to walk, they
lay hold of everything and try to eat it. Bits of paper,
lumps of sealing-wax, the mucous matter from the nose,
all appear to them to be things to eat. Constant guard
has to be kept to prevent them from doing themselves an
injury. Fruits and berries they cannot resist. Cases of
poisoning very naturally are extremely frequent, and as
every one must know of instances, I shall mention only a
single case. “Messrs. Beadle and Sons, oil manufacturers
at Boston, had thrown out, from the door of their establishment,
a quantity of castor beans that were decayed and
useless. Some children playing in the street mistook the
seeds for pistachio nuts, and shared them with their friends.
All the children seem to have eaten of them, with the result
that more than seventy showed serious symptoms of
poisoning.”<a id='r84'></a><a href='#f84' class='c014'><sup>[84]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The consumption of ergotised rye and of maize contaminated
with certain leguminous plants (<em>Lathyrus</em>) frequently
produces epidemics of poisoning without instinct
intervening to protect the victims.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the large intestine, acting as an asylum of harmful
microbes, is a source of intoxication from within, the aberrant
instinct of man leads him to poison himself from without
with alcohol and ether, opium and morphia. The widespread
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>results of alcoholism show plainly the prevalent
existence in man of a want of harmony between the instinct
for choosing food and the instinct of preservation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The digestive apparatus, then, affords abundant proof
of the imperfection and disharmony of our nature. Moreover,
there are many other proofs, as I shall show in
the chapters to follow.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>I<br> <span class='c012'><em>Remarks on the disharmonies in the human organs of sense and perception.—Rudimentary parts of the reproductive apparatus.—Origin and function of the hymen</em></span></h4>

<p class='c016'>The digestive organs are not alone amongst the parts of
the human body in exhibiting a greater or lesser disharmony.
More than fifty years ago, a great German physiologist,
Johannes Müller, showed that although the human
eye was regarded as a very perfect organ, its power of
correction for aberration of light was poor. Helmholz,
another famous German man of science, stated that the
optical study of the eye brought complete disillusion.
“Nature,” he said, “seems to have packed this organ with
mistakes, as if with the avowed purpose of destroying any
possible foundation for the theory that organs are adapted
to their environment.” Not only the eye, but the other
organs by means of which we are conscious of the outside
world, present natural disharmony. Therein lies the cause
of our want of certainty about the sources of our perceptions.
Memory, the faculty that registers our mental
processes, becomes active much later than other faculties
lodged in the brain. If the new-born human child were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>relatively as well developed as the young guinea-pig, it is
probable that we should know far more as to the history
of our consciousness of the external world. But without
lingering over the disharmonies in our senses and faculties,
I shall pass at once to a consideration of the apparatus for
maintaining the species.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have shown that the alimentary tract, the chief organ
involved in the maintenance of the individual life, affords
no proof of the theory that human nature is perfect. Is it
the case that the organs of reproduction give a better
result? When I wished to describe the most perfect
examples of harmony to be found amongst plants, I chose
the mechanism by which fertilisation is accomplished in
flowers. The persistence of the species is secured, in the
case of flowers, by a marvellous series of structures and
functions.</p>

<p class='c007'>Is the maintenance of the human species similarly provided
for? A detailed investigation of the male and
female human reproductive organs shows that these contain
parts of diverse origin. The apparatus contains portions
of extremely ancient origin, and portions that have been
acquired recently. The internal organs display traces of
a remote hermaphroditism. In the male, there occur traces
of the female apparatus, rudiments of the uterus and fallopian
tubes. In the female, on the other hand, rudiments
of the male structure persist. These traces date very far
back in the history of the race, for they occur also in most
other vertebrates. The facts seem to indicate that, at a
very remote period, the ancestral vertebrates were hermaphrodite,
and that they became divided into males and
females only gradually, still retaining in each sex traces of
the other sex. Such traces occur frequently, even in adult
man, in the form of rudimentary organs (known as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>organs of Weber, of Rosenmüller, and so forth). The
rudiments not only are functionless but sometimes, as frequently
happens with atrophied structures, form the starting-point
of monstrous growths, or of tumours that interfere
with health. Thus the hypertrophy of a part of the male
prostate gland (the organ of Weber) brings about the formation
of a <em>uterus masculinus</em>, and so produces a sort of
abnormal hermaphroditism. The rudimentary organs in
the male reproductive apparatus frequently are the starting-points
of hydatid cysts. In the female, cysts such as those
of the <em>parovaria</em> are produced by the proliferation of rudimentary
structures. These, although usually benign, not
infrequently become malignant. Lawson Tait,<a id='r85'></a><a href='#f85' class='c014'><sup>[85]</sup></a> a celebrated
English surgeon, has published a case of this kind.
He removed from a young woman a parovarian cyst that
was apparently benign, but in six weeks symptoms of cancer
arose, and the patient died of cancer in three months.</p>

<p class='c007'>A comparison of the rudimentary organs in the human
reproductive apparatus with those in the similar structures
of lower animals, shows that many relics have degenerated
further in man than in other animals. Thus the duct of
the embryonic kidney (known as the Wolffian body) is of
rare occurrence in adult man, although it is retained throughout
life in the case of some herbivorous animals, in which it
is known as Gaertner’s duct. There are, however, many
rudimentary organs in the human reproductive apparatus,
organs that are always useless and not infrequently more
or less harmful to health and life.</p>

<p class='c007'>Alongside organs which have been useless from time
immemorial, the reproductive system of man possesses
structures of recent acquisition. These deserve special
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>attention, as it might have been supposed that in them
would have been found special instances of adaptation to
the reproductive function.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have already referred (chap. iii.) to the discussions
that have taken place over the simian origin of man. All
attempts to demonstrate the presence in the human brain
of parts that were absent in the simian brain have failed.
It is a curious fact that man displays a more marked difference
from monkeys in the structure of the reproductive
system than in the structure of the brain. There is no <em>os
penis</em> in man. This bone, which facilitates intromission,
occurs in many vertebrates, not only among rodents and
carnivora, which are widely separated from man, but in
many monkeys, and most notably in anthropoid apes.<a id='r86'></a><a href='#f86' class='c014'><sup>[86]</sup></a> For
some reason impossible to establish, man has lost this bone.
It may be that certain ossifications of most rare occurrence<a id='r87'></a><a href='#f87' class='c014'><sup>[87]</sup></a>
may represent an atavistic inheritance from our remote
ancestors.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the male sex the difference between man and the
anthropoid ape is the loss of an organ; in the female sex
it is the acquisition of an organ. The hymen, the physical
indication of virginity, is peculiar to the human race. That
organ would serve the purpose of those disputants who make
every effort to discover the existence of a structure peculiarly
human, far better than the posterior lobe of the brain, or
the hippocampus minor. Bischoff<a id='r88'></a><a href='#f88' class='c014'><sup>[88]</sup></a> has determined its
absence in the anthropoid apes, and his result has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>confirmed by other observers. Deniker<a id='r89'></a><a href='#f89' class='c014'><sup>[89]</sup></a> failed to find
it either in the fœtal gorilla or in the young gorilla. In
the case of the fœtus of the gibbon, he found a slight elevation
round the entrance to the vagina “which might be
homologised with the hymen,”<a id='r90'></a><a href='#f90' class='c014'><sup>[90]</sup></a> but which, however, was
not the membrane in question. Deniker<a id='r91'></a><a href='#f91' class='c014'><sup>[91]</sup></a> himself decided
that the “membrane was absent in anthropoid apes at all
ages.” Weidersheim, in his summary of the organisation
of the human body,<a id='r92'></a><a href='#f92' class='c014'><sup>[92]</sup></a> also sets down the fact that “in
monkeys a hymen is not present.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The fact that this structure appears late in the development
of the female fœtus bears out the supposition that it
has been acquired recently by the race. According to
several observers, who agree in this matter, the membrane
does not develop until at least the nineteenth week of
fœtal life.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although organs very ancient in origin, and now become
degenerate rudiments, may be useless, it is to be expected
that an organ of recent appearance and still in a progressive
condition, would have an important function. Of what
utility is this membrane to a woman? Wiedersheim<a id='r93'></a><a href='#f93' class='c014'><sup>[93]</sup></a>
remarks that its function has not been made out.</p>

<p class='c007'>The hymen sometimes plays a large part in family and
social relations, and, regarded as the evidence for virginity,
has had moral significance bestowed on it. A minute
examination of this structure is frequently a part of the
judicial procedure in cases of supposed rape and so forth.
The destruction of the hymen has led to the death of many
hundreds of men and women.</p>

<p class='c007'>From our point of view, however, it is the possible physiological
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>function of this structure that is interesting. It
seems impossible to conclude otherwise than that in existing
races it has practically no functional value. Its atrophy
as the result of sexual congress not only is no bar to sexual
relations, but removes an unpleasant impediment. In
many races the structure is removed as soon as possible.
In some parts of China it is destroyed as part of the toilet
of young children, and indeed many Chinese physicians are
ignorant of its existence. A similar state of affairs occurs
in some parts of India. In Brazil, among the tribe of
Machacuras, virgins, in the European sense, do not exist,
for the mothers destroy the hymen in female children soon
after birth. In Kamchatka the aborigines regard it as
disgraceful to be married with the hymen intact, and the
mothers operate on their daughters.<a id='r94'></a><a href='#f94' class='c014'><sup>[94]</sup></a> Among other races,
again, the disagreeable duty of defloration is assigned to
special persons. Among the natives of the Philippines
there formerly existed well-paid public officials the duty of
whom was to destroy the virginity of the girls and so to
make marriage pleasanter for the husbands. A similar
custom occurs among the inhabitants of New Caledonia,
and Moncelon states that there virginity is held in little
esteem. “I have proof of the curious circumstance,” he
wrote, “that when a husband shrinks from destroying the
virginity of his wife, he employs some one from a regular
profession to take his place.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Such examples, selected from amongst many, may be
taken as proof that even such a peculiar and recently
acquired organ has not a physiological use.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the other hand, especially among Christians and
Mahomedans, the existence of the hymen in an intact
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>condition is regarded as very important. The ancient Jews
began to set a high value on virginity. According to the
old Mosaic law, if, at the time of her marriage, a young girl
were found to be no longer a virgin, “Then they shall bring
out the damsel to the door of her father’s house, and the
men of her city shall stone her with stones that she die;
because she hath wrought folly in Israel, to play the whore
in her father’s house” (Deut. xxii. 21). The religions that
have sprung from Judaism have retained this old view
of virginity, although in an attenuated form. Among some
Christian peoples, material proofs of virginity at the time of
marriage are demanded, and among some Mahomedans such
proofs are exhibited to friends and relations on the day
after marriage. However, the actual defloration is not
always left to the husband, but among Arabs and Copts and
amongst the natives of Egypt, the operation is performed
by a specially selected matron.<a id='r95'></a><a href='#f95' class='c014'><sup>[95]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It is plain, then, that this membrane is of no direct service
in the sexual process. It may even give rise to more or
less serious misfortune. Thus, when it is unusually rigid,
the adjacent peritoneum may be torn and the results may
be disastrous. Occasionally the rupture of an abnormally
vascular membrane may give rise to bleeding of a prolonged
and even fatal character.<a id='r96'></a><a href='#f96' class='c014'><sup>[96]</sup></a> Moreover the membrane is a
frequent seat of ulcers, specific or otherwise.<a id='r97'></a><a href='#f97' class='c014'><sup>[97]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>I have already mentioned that among some races a
rigorous toilet involves the destruction of the hymen. It
is plain that the existence of the membrane interferes
with strict hygiene of the vagina, especially at the periods.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>Probably some blood is retained by the membrane and
furnishes a soil for microbes that may be dangerous to health.
It is quite possible that certain forms of anæmia, as for
instance the chloranæmia of virgins, may be produced by
microbial growth. This would easily explain why marriage
is the readiest cure for such anæmia, as marriage involves
destruction of the membrane, and so makes possible the
complete discharge of fluid from the vagina.<a id='r98'></a><a href='#f98' class='c014'><sup>[98]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>What then can be the meaning of this organ, useless as
it is for the sexual functions, sometimes dangerous to health,
an organ that is no ancestral heritage and that must be
destroyed by the act of sexual union? Formerly, when it
was accepted that characters acquired in individual life
could be transmitted to offspring, the question was asked
as to why this membrane had not disappeared. The
instance was one of those which helped to overthrow the
dogma of the inheritance of acquired characters.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although it is useless to existing man, this organ may yet
come to be explained by science. As yet we have to fall
back on suppositions. The hypothesis which seems most
probable is that in the earlier period of the existence of the
human race, sexual relations were begun at a very early
age, before the male organs were mature. Under such
circumstances the hymen would not only not have been
a barrier, but would have made congress more satisfactory.
Gradually the hymen would have become dilated without
being torn, until it was capable of admitting the adult organ.
This hypothesis implies that in early times the membrane
was not brutally torn, but that it was gradually dilated and
that violent rupture is a modern necessity. In support of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>the hypothesis it may be mentioned that amongst certain
living races sexual union begins at a very early age. In
Ceylon, marriage takes place when the boys are from seven
to ten years old and when the girls are from four to six
years, according to Roer, or about eight years according to
Beierlein. After the actual wedding ceremony the bride
returns to the house of her parents, and it is only a few
years later, when she is adult, that she goes to her husband.
Roer states that he has seen cases where a father and son
were attending school together.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among the Vedas, a low caste of tropical India, boys
marry at the age of from fifteen to sixteen years, certainly
before the sexual organs have attained their full dimensions.
The missionary Etern was struck with the agitation of the
natives of Keradif (in Abyssinia) when they were ordered
within fourteen days to marry all their boys more than
fourteen years old to girls more than nine.<a id='r99'></a><a href='#f99' class='c014'><sup>[99]</sup></a> In Madagascar,
in the beginning of the seventeenth century, it was
the custom for boys to marry at an age of from ten to
twelve years. The natives of German New Guinea marry
their boys at the age of fourteen to fifteen. Even in
England a law still exists permitting marriage to boys
fourteen years old. The law is now a dead letter, but is
evidence of the ancient practice.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is known that even at the present time the hymen is
not always ruptured in sexual congress. Budin has recorded
its existence in seventeen per cent. of primiparous women.
Among seventy-five cases of women in their first confinements
he found the hymen intact in thirteen cases. Since provision
for children has fallen on fathers these have taken
to deferring marriage to a later age than when children
were left to the mother. That is the probable reason why
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>there are now fewer married boys. Thus, formerly, the
proportion of women who at the first childbirth still possessed
unruptured hymens, was much greater, and it is not
difficult to suppose that in still earlier times such a condition
was normal. It is plain that there is here an instance of
a very recently acquired disharmony.</p>

<p class='c007'>The homology between certain portions of the male and
female reproductive apparatus is well known. The male
homologue of the female hymen is a little fold that hinders
the mingling of urine with the seminal fluid during emission,
and that is known to anatomists as the <em>caput gallinaginis</em>
or <em>colliculus seminalis</em>. It is very much smaller than
the hymen, so that we cannot regard the latter as a rudimentary
homologue of a useful organ. However, the prepuce
of the male is a clear instance of the presence in the
male organs of useless parts. It is removed by circumcision
among very many races, such as the Hebrews and Arabs,
and other Mahomedans, and amongst Persians, negroes,
Hindus, Tartars, and its absence seems to bring about no
inconvenience.</p>

<h4 class='c015'>II<br> <em>Evolution and significance of the menstrual flow in women.—Precocious marriage among primitive and uncivilised races.—Disharmony between age of puberty and age of nubility.—Age of marriage.—Examples of disharmony in the development of the reproductive function.</em></h4>

<p class='c016'>Notwithstanding their imperfections, the human organs of
reproduction are able to fulfil their functions. A close
scrutiny, however, shows that there are many sides on
which they are disharmonious or badly adapted.</p>

<p class='c007'>The occurrence of bleeding is usually a sign of disease.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>Bleeding from the nose or of the lungs or intestines or
kidneys is an indication of disease more or less serious.
Discharge of blood from the female reproductive organs
may also be an indication of disease, as for instance when
due to tumours of the uterus. The only exception to the
rule is the periodic flow in the case of women, by which they
lose hundreds of grammes of blood (100 to 600 gr.). There
is something paradoxical in such a physiological occurrence,
and it deserves minute consideration.</p>

<p class='c007'>These periodic losses, unlike the possession of a hymen,
are not a peculiarity of the human female. “Heat” in
lower animals is analogous, although in that case the chief
indications are swellings of the mucous membrane with a
slight discharge of fluid, hardly tinged with blood. The state
indicates the awakening of the sexual instinct and readiness
for coition.<a id='r100'></a><a href='#f100' class='c014'><sup>[100]</sup></a> Among monkeys there has been observed a
flow much more closely resembling that of woman. In the
case of macaques and cercopitheci, it has been observed
even that the flow is monthly. Heape,<a id='r101'></a><a href='#f101' class='c014'><sup>[101]</sup></a> while in British
India, took advantage of a valuable opportunity for making
observations on this subject.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among two hundred and thirty females of <em>Macacus rhesus</em>
of which the greater number were adult or nearly so, seventeen
displayed signs of menstruation, consisting of a swelling
of the genitalia accompanied by the discharge of a pale and
viscid fluid. Usually the flow assumed a pale rose tint, due
to the presence in it of blood corpuscles, but cases where
it was highly coloured were rare.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although they are distinctly analogous to the menstrual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>flows of women, these occurrences in monkeys are distinguished
by the predominance of the swelling of the genitalia,
the viscid character of the discharge, and the relative
absence of blood. They present a condition intermediate
between the “heat” of lower animals and the human
phenomena.</p>

<p class='c007'>In anthropoid apes a similar menstruation has been
observed. Bolau, Ehlers, and Hermes, record it in the case
of the chimpanzee. “At this period,” wrote Hartmann,<a id='r102'></a><a href='#f102' class='c014'><sup>[102]</sup></a>
“swelling and reddening of the genitalia occurred. The
labiæ majores, which are usually inconspicuous, enlarged
greatly, and a similar increase took place in the labiæ minores
and the clitoris.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In the case of women swelling of the genitalia is very
slightly marked, and the chief occurrence is the flow of
blood. It is plain, then, that something new has been
acquired in the menstruation of women.</p>

<p class='c007'>The condition of the flow at the present time is probably
the result of modifications acquired recently in the history
of the race. Among primitive peoples sexual union occurred
at a very early age, and pregnancy occurred before menstruation.
The latter did not appear during pregnancy nor in
the time of suckling, and probably the latter was hardly
over before a new pregnancy had occurred. In that way
there was no opportunity for the onset of menstruation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The human capacity for procreation throughout the year
made the race extremely prolific. Probably this prolificness
is the reason why man has spread over the surface of the
earth, and has multiplied so enormously, in spite of the
barriers to his progress and the high rate of mortality to
which he is subjected.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>Instances are known from recent observation of pregnancies
occurring before the onset of menstruation. According
to Rhode, among the Guatos, Indians inhabiting the
mouth of the Rio Sâo Lourenzo in Paraguay, married women
not more than five to eight years of age are to be met with,
and these must have married before menstruation. Among
the Vedas of tropical India, girls marry before they are nine
years of age, and have relations with their husbands before
sexual maturity. In Chiras in Persia, girls marry before
puberty, and while their chests are still flat. In Syria,
according to Robson, girls marry at the age of ten, and so
before puberty. Du Chaillu related that the Achira of
West Africa did not defer marriage until after the appearance
of puberty. Abbadie, while on his voyage in Nubia,
found that men bought young girls and had sexual relations
with them before the time of menstruation. Among the
Atjeh of Sumatra, girls marry at an age certainly before
that of puberty, as they have hardly lost their first set of
teeth. Although the husbands are a few years older, they
are still unfitted for sexual union. The couples sleep together,
and attempt sexual union before they are fitted for it.
Among the islanders of Viti, again, marriage takes place
before puberty.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ancient Hindoos married at a very early age. Bötlingk
quotes from the Sanscrit poems in which hell was
awarded to the fathers of girls who had not been married
when puberty came on. In other verses it was written
that not only the father but also the mother and the elder
brother were to be carried down into hell if the daughter
began to menstruate before she had been married; the girl
herself was to descend to the lowest degree of Çûdrâ, and
was never to be taken as a wife.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is no doubt as to the possible fertility of marriages
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>contracted at these early ages. Polak<a id='r103'></a><a href='#f103' class='c014'><sup>[103]</sup></a> gives examples
taken from Persia. It is not necessary for impregnation that
it should have been preceded by a menstrual flow. Facts
making this clear have occurred not only in warm climates
but in our own latitude. Rakhmanoff,<a id='r104'></a><a href='#f104' class='c014'><sup>[104]</sup></a> in Russia, attended
in childbirth a woman not more than fourteen years of age,
of poor constitution, and badly nourished, and with features
still infantine. Menstruation had not yet taken place; the
confinement was normal.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is reasonable to suppose that in former times these
early marriages of girls under the age of puberty were more
common, if indeed they were not customary. In such circumstances
menstruation would have been a rare phenomenon.</p>

<p class='c007'>It must be remembered that the examples of menstruation
observed in the case of monkeys were taken from creatures
living in abnormal conditions, isolated in zoological gardens
and passing their lives in captivity. It is highly probable that
the periods as they exist to-day, with copious sanguineous
discharge, are a recent acquisition of the human race.</p>

<p class='c007'>As he emerged from the primitive condition man had
to restrain his prolificness. The history of savages and of
civilisations shows that progress and culture have been
accompanied by a rise in the age for marriage. In this way
the menstrual periods could develop without check, and
attain the present condition. In these circumstances it is
not wonderful that menstruation should appear so abnormal
and even pathological. A copious discharge of blood, preceded
and accompanied by pain and by nervous and mental
distress as so frequently happens, has no apparent kinship
with the processes of normal life.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>It is now easy to see why among so many races there are
special rules made for women during this period. Most of
the races of the earth, says Ploss, regard menstruating
women as impure. The occurrence is so widespread that
it is unnecessary to adduce particular cases, but a few with
some point of special interest may be noticed. Thus, among
the Hindoos a high-caste woman is regarded as a pariah in
the first day of the period, and as one of the murderers of
Buddha on the second day. Among many races a woman
in this condition is forbidden to come near men, or to touch
a number of objects, as she is regarded as capable of setting
up many diseases and of doing serious damage. The Germans
of the eighteenth century believed that the hair of a menstruating
woman buried in manure would engender snakes.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not surprising that the origin of menstruation has
been attributed frequently to evil spirits. The Iranians held
that it appeared first in Dchahi, the goddess of immorality.<a id='r105'></a><a href='#f105' class='c014'><sup>[105]</sup></a>
Such opinions implied vaguely that there was something
abnormal in the process. The history of the evolution of
menstruation explains well the origin of such a notion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another bizarre and apparently abnormal feature of the
reproductive processes receives explanation in the history
of its evolution. The feature in question is the painfulness
of childbirth. It is truly astonishing and singular to find
a phenomenon essentially normal from the point of view
of physiology accompanied by pain of so marked a character.
No doubt other animals suffer during labour, but
among the mammalia woman undergoes the severest pain.</p>

<p class='c007'>Observations made on several Europeans who have been
brought to bed at an abnormally early age have shown
that, contrary to all expectation, parturition was easy and
the sequelæ normal.<a id='r106'></a><a href='#f106' class='c014'><sup>[106]</sup></a> Moreover, Dr. Dionij has stated his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>opinion that of two cases of a first childbirth at the ages
respectively of fifteen and of forty years, he would prefer
the earlier age. The daughters of the colonists in the
Antilles were accustomed to marry at very early ages. In
1667 Du Tertre related that a young woman of that region
had informed him that the birth of her first child took place
when she was twelve years and a half of age, and that the
process lasted no more than a quarter of an hour and
had been painless. The missionary Beierlein practised for
long in Madras, where marriages were very early, and found
that parturition was much more easy than in Europe.<a id='r107'></a><a href='#f107' class='c014'><sup>[107]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>On the other hand, certain facts show that too young
mothers are subject to a very heavy rate of mortality during
childbirth, and soon after it. The most salient fact in this
connection is furnished by Hassenstein, who has stated that
the mortality of labour cases in Abyssinia is 30 per cent.,
and who has attributed this death-rate to the circumstance
that marriage takes place before the body of the woman is
sufficiently developed.<a id='r108'></a><a href='#f108' class='c014'><sup>[108]</sup></a> In British India the disadvantages
of precocious marriage have been repeatedly urged;
and in a petition relating to this subject, Dr. Mansell referred
to the case of a woman of twelve years of age in whom
parturition was interfered with by the undeveloped condition
of the pelvis, so that the head of the child had to be
destroyed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Matthews Duncan, the well-known English obstetrician,
paid much attention to the mortality of labour cases, with
the object of deciding the best age for marriage. He came
to the conclusion that women from twenty to twenty-four
years of age were best fitted for labour, that is to say, showed
the lowest rate of mortality during labour or as a result of
labour. He also showed that such women were most fertile,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>and that the development of the pelvic bones was completed
at that period of life. Women who were of a lower or
higher age showed a greater mortality rate in connection
with childbirth.</p>

<p class='c007'>The facts of which I have just given a summary lead
directly to a most striking instance of disharmony exhibited
in the order of the development of the human reproductive
apparatus. Puberty declares itself in a woman by the
beginning of menstruation at a time when girls still possess
infantile characters and when the bones of the pelvic basin
are not yet fully developed. Obviously there is a disharmony
between puberty and the general maturity of the body,
that is to say, the nubile condition.</p>

<p class='c007'>This disharmony becomes still more evident upon a closer
examination of the phases of development of the different
reproductive functions. In the human race, reproduction
is brought about by the union of the sexes suggested by
sympathy or mutual love. The sexual union makes it
possible for the male elements or spermatozoa to reach the
eggs and fertilise them by passing into them. It might
have been expected that the different steps in the process
would have been attuned so as to act in harmony. As a
matter of fact there is no such relation. The different
factors of the sexual function develop independently and
unharmoniously.</p>

<p class='c007'>Love and the sexual sense in the human race appear
before the other factors in the process. Ramdohr,<a id='r109'></a><a href='#f109' class='c014'><sup>[109]</sup></a> in the
eighteenth century, stated that little boys frequently exhibit
amorousness towards women. They are capable of being
strongly affected by jealousy and by desire of exclusive
possession of the coveted woman. This fact is well known,
and has been related of famous personages. Thus Dante,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>at the age of nine, fell in love with Beatrice; Canova was in
love when he was little more than six years of age, and Lord
Byron was in love with Mary Duff at the age of seven.<a id='r110'></a><a href='#f110' class='c014'><sup>[110]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Sexual excitability appears at an age when there is no
question but that the sexual elements are undeveloped. In
infants still in the cradle, observers have noticed movements
and attitudes showing the presence of sexual excitability.
Curschmann and Fürbringer,<a id='r111'></a><a href='#f111' class='c014'><sup>[111]</sup></a> both competent clinicians,
have noticed these feelings in children under the age of
five. Later on in life, the development of the sensibility
is more common, and is practically universal among boys
before the time at which the spermatozoa are ripe.</p>

<p class='c007'>This disharmony is the cause of onanism, which is common
everywhere among boys. Before ordinary sexual congress
is possible for them, boys experience the characteristic
pleasure of the sexual sensations, and by a kind of natural
instinct learn self-gratification. Onanism is sometimes
defined as a “gratification of the sexual desire by unnatural
means.”<a id='r112'></a><a href='#f112' class='c014'><sup>[112]</sup></a> But it is man’s constitution itself that permits
the development of the sensation precociously, before the
development of sexual maturity. Letourneau is right when
he says that such sexual aberrations are abnormal, but not
unnatural, as they occur among animals.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the case of young boys the habit is so common that,
according to Christian,<a id='r113'></a><a href='#f113' class='c014'><sup>[113]</sup></a> “very few are able to say that
they have avoided it completely.” The same writer asks
the question: “If it be remembered that onanism among
certain peoples, at certain times, has been recognised as an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>ordinary event, it is difficult to avoid asking if there be
not a latent vice, hidden in the depths of human nature, and
ready to be provoked into activity by very small causes?”
The answer is sufficiently plain. The cause of onanism,
this “vice” or “crime,” as Tissot and other authors have
called it, undoubtedly is the result of a natural disharmony
in the human constitution, of a premature development of
sexual sensation. Among the most civilised races and the
lowest savages the mode of satisfying the premature demand
is equally common.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is to be noticed that onanism is more common and
earlier developed in the male sex. The development of
sexual irritability in the female occurs very irregularly. In
some races onanism is so much a custom among little girls
that no attempt is made to conceal the practice. This occurs,
for instance, among certain Hottentot tribes, and is referred
to openly in talk and legends.<a id='r114'></a><a href='#f114' class='c014'><sup>[114]</sup></a> Similar instances occur
elsewhere, but in most races the practice is thought wrong,
and is concealed as much as possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among girls,<a id='r115'></a><a href='#f115' class='c014'><sup>[115]</sup></a> onanism is less frequent than in the case
of boys, a circumstance in relation with the fact that sexual
sensation usually appears much later in the female sex. It
is almost a general rule that girls who have arrived at sexual
maturity have not acquired sexual irritability, while to
many it comes only gradually after marriage. Sometimes
it does not occur until after the first child has been born.
On the other hand, love begins very early in young girls,
although it long retains a platonic character and is not
associated with sexual sensation until much later.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>The maturity of the spermatozoa in the male comes long
after the development of sexual irritability and of love.
None the less, it comes before the organism of the male
is actually ready. It happens, in consequence, especially
among the highly civilised peoples, that marriage and
regular unions are impossible at the right time. The youth
has his education to finish, his profession to choose, and he
must be ready to support children before he is able to
marry. As civilisation advances, the age of marriage
becomes later and later. In the case of Europeans, sexual
maturity occurs in the male at the age of twelve to fourteen
years, while the average age at the first marriage is shown
in the following table:—</p>

<p class='c021'>These figures show clearly what a gap there is between the
coming of sexual maturity and the age at which marriage
can be undertaken.</p>

<p class='c007'>The decay of the reproductive functions shows a series
of disharmonies similar to those that occur during development.
Spermatozoa continue to be formed throughout the
greater part of the life of a man, and may still be found
even in very old men. Pawloff, for instance, discovered
that they were present in abundance in the case of a man
at the age of ninety-four, and this observation is not unique.<a id='r117'></a><a href='#f117' class='c014'><sup>[117]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>But the presence of ripe spermatozoa is not the only condition
necessary for functional virility. In the case of old
men it happens frequently that there is incapacity to make
normal use of the spermatozoa that are produced. This
brings about a series of discomforts in the sexual functions
of advanced life which, however, do not prevent the retention
of the specific sensation and desire until a very extreme
old age. Doctors, in hospitals devoted to old men, have
noticed to what an extent their patients are engrossed by
sexuality. Even some of the ancient authors have noticed
how the amorous sentiments of old men turn into a perverted
attraction to youths.</p>

<p class='c007'>Sexual irritability and amorousness not only appear
before sexual maturity and general fitness of the organism
for marriage, but they remain after the disappearance of
these. It is remarkable to notice how profound is the difference
between the disharmonies of the reproductive functions
in man and the perfect condition of adaptation of the same
functions in the higher plants. In the case of the higher
plants, as I described in my second chapter, the arrangements
are complicated on account of the necessary mediation
of insect life. Notwithstanding this, the perfection of
the adaptation is remarkable. At the exact time when the
reproductive products are ripe, the petals open and the
nectar is secreted, while, in addition, at this time many
flowers discharge odours agreeable to insects. Attracted by
the scents and colours, the insects visit the flowers in quest
of pollen or nectar, and, becoming dusted with pollen, carry
it to the stigmas of the next flowers they visit. As soon as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>fertilisation has taken place the petals fade, the scents are
no longer produced, and the insects cease to visit the flowers
to which they are no longer necessary.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not surprising that the disharmonies in the human
reproductive apparatus are a frequent source of trouble.
Little children, in whom sexual irritability has awakened
prematurely, learn to satisfy it by means called “unnatural.”
In many cases damage rapidly follows. “In the child,”
wrote Dr. Christian, “there is no secretion of spermatozoa,
and it is in the child that the results of onanism are most
disastrous to the organism, and disastrous almost in inverse
proportion to the age.<a id='r118'></a><a href='#f118' class='c014'><sup>[118]</sup></a> It is in early infancy that this aberration
merits the evil reputation that it has acquired; it
compromises health, intelligence, and even life. Quite
young children wither, becoming pale, stupid, and fragile,
when they have acquired this disastrous habit. The evil
is almost entirely a consequence of the unripeness of the
organism for sexuality.” Happily these evil occurrences
are rare.</p>

<p class='c007'>A publication by Tissot, a Swiss doctor, on the subject of
onanism, made a sensation in the eighteenth century. The
book was full of exaggeration, and it was very inexact, but
it contained interesting confessions from persons who had
contracted the habit. A woman wrote to Tissot in the
following terms: “But for the restraint of religion, I should
have put an end to my life, which is ruined by my own fault.”
Not infrequently the vice leads to melancholia.</p>

<p class='c007'>Other unfortunate results come from the ripening of the
sexual products before the organism is ready for marriage,
and before the character has been formed. As men cannot
contract marriage before they are ready for it, irregular and
frequently harmful sexual aberration may occur.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>The survival of this specific irritability until too late a
period of life is another source of disaster. Old men who
can neither excite passion nor satisfy it, often become
victims of their own amorousness and unassuaged passions.
It has been shown that passion may survive after the complete
atrophy of the functions of the organs. Similarly it
is the case that women from whom the ovaries have been
removed, may continue to retain sexual irritability completely.</p>

<p class='c007'>Disharmony of sexuality may also occur between persons
of different sexes. The fact that sexuality is usually more
precocious in the male sex often produces a disharmony in
the case of married persons. At the time when a woman
is still in full possession of this specific irritability, the appetite
in the man may be on the wane. From this disharmony
there often follows conjugal infidelity or passion between
persons of the same sex.</p>

<p class='c007'>Schopenhauer devoted attention to this subject and wrote
as follows: “That nature herself may produce a condition
totally opposed to the natural function offers a paradoxical
problem of very deep interest.”<a id='r119'></a><a href='#f119' class='c014'><sup>[119]</sup></a> It is clear, however, when
we consider the disharmonies in the development and activities
of the functions in question, that the apparently
paradoxical and strange aberrations of sexuality are natural
enough.</p>

<p class='c007'>The existing disharmony gives rise to many evils from
earliest youth to advanced age, and, consequently, it is
not surprising to find that religions have denounced sexuality
more or less severely. Dr. Christian expresses his
astonishment “that in nearly all religions it has been
considered a homage to the Deity to abstain from sexual
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>intercourse.”<a id='r120'></a><a href='#f120' class='c014'><sup>[120]</sup></a> It is simply because the disharmonies
of sexuality lead to sexual aberrations that religions have
found cause for denouncing human nature as vile.<a id='r121'></a><a href='#f121' class='c014'><sup>[121]</sup></a></p>

<h4 class='c015'>III<br> <em>Disharmonies in the family instincts.—Artificial abortion.—Desertion and infanticide.—Disharmonies in the social instincts.</em></h4>

<p class='c016'>As the functions of reproduction are seated deep in the
organic world and none the less present cases of striking
disharmony in mankind, it is not surprising to find similar
want of adaptation in the family instincts of man, as these
instincts have been acquired more recently and are less
widespread in the living world.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been shown that the animal world provides many
examples of onanism and of aberrations of sexual congress.
On the other hand, there are no cases in the animal world
in which pregnancy is destroyed by aberrant instincts.</p>

<p class='c007'>To the human race belongs the distinction of having
invented modes of sexual congress which are necessarily
barren. No doubt the loss of the <em>os penis</em> has made such
occurrences more easy, as the presence of that bone would
render interruption of coition more difficult. But there are
many ways in which the spermatozoa may be prevented
from accomplishing their function, and these are so common
and so familiar that it is unnecessary to enumerate them.
In civilised countries procreation is limited chiefly by such
means. In its early days, the human race must have been
distinguished by its unusual procreative capacity, but with
the growth of civilisation many devices have been employed
to limit that.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>Savages and races of low civilisation have recourse to
artificial abortion rather than to means for preventing
fertilisation, and abortion is almost universal among them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The great treatise of Ploss, “Das Weib,” to which I
have made repeated reference, contains a whole chapter<a id='r122'></a><a href='#f122' class='c014'><sup>[122]</sup></a> on
this subject. Deliberate abortion with the object of limiting
the number of children is customary all over the globe.
In most primitive races and among peoples of low civilisation
it is practised openly without the smallest restraint.
Many of these peoples have adopted the custom of limiting
the family to two children by procuring abortion in subsequent
pregnancies. The aborigines of Kaisar and of the
islands of Watubela observe the rule strictly. Among the
natives of the islands of Aaru it is rare to find more than
three children in a family, because any others are destroyed
by artificial abortion.</p>

<p class='c007'>A similar custom is widespread in India, being quite as
common among the Hindoos who are ruled by England as
among independent races. In the peninsula of Kutch,
women frequently procure abortion, and one woman boasted
to Macmurdo that she had made use of the practice five
times. Abortion is equally common in Africa and America.</p>

<p class='c007'>Even in Europe there are nations amongst which abortion
is permitted within certain limits. The Turks do not
regard a fœtus as being really alive until after the fifth
month, and have no scruple in causing its abortion. Even
at later stages, when the operation becomes criminal, it is
frequently practised. In 1872, at Constantinople, more than
three thousand cases of abortion were brought before the
Courts in a period of ten months. Under such circumstances
it is not surprising that illegitimate children are
rare in the East.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>Artificial abortion is not a modern invention, but was
common in ancient times. The old Greeks practised it
openly, without any legal restraint. Plato regarded it as
within the province of the midwife, and Aristotle permitted
it to married people when a pregnancy that was not desired
took place.</p>

<p class='c007'>Steller, writing of the natives of Kamchatka of the
eighteenth century, stated that among them marriage was
contracted rather for sensual gratification than for the
procreation of children, because they interfered with pregnancies
by various kinds of medicaments and by violent
operative interferences.</p>

<p class='c007'>The arts by which abortion has been produced are numerous
and varied. In addition to the administration of drugs,
chiefly of vegetable origin, implements have been employed.
The natives of Greenland use the ribs of seals or of the
walrus, and the Hawaians of the Sandwich Islands employ
for the purpose a wooden implement fashioned as a deity.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the other hand, certain races have strongly opposed
the practice of abortion. In the ancient world such races were
the Medes, the Bactrians, the Persians, and Jews. Among
the ancient Incas, abortion was a crime punished with death.
Later on, the Christian nations followed this view. However,
the reprobation of abortion occurs only in a comparatively
small number of the nations of the earth, and even amongst
these the practice is common in secret.</p>

<p class='c007'>Animals which are unable to procure abortion very often
destroy their young, as I described in the second chapter
of this volume. In the human race, infanticide is too
common. The Greeks and Romans did not regard the
newly born infants as possessing any right to live. The
old Germans held themselves free to expose their infants.
The Arabs, before the faith of Islam had spread to them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>were in the habit of burying many female children alive.
In India a similar custom is common, and in China it is
notorious. According to figures collected by Eitel,<a id='r123'></a><a href='#f123' class='c014'><sup>[123]</sup></a> the
Chinese of the province of Canton very often kill female
children immediately after birth. “It may be said,” he
wrote, “that the murder of female infants is the general
rule among the Hak-lo, and especially among the Hak-ka
of the agricultural classes. The Hak-ka themselves estimate
the number of female children exposed as about two-thirds
of those born.” In a little village in which the author
lived for several years, an investigation, made with the help
of some Christians, showed that without exception women
who had given birth to two children had killed at least one
of them.</p>

<p class='c007'>In Tahiti two-thirds of new-born children are killed,
those of the female sex making up the greater part of the
numbers. The first three infants and all twins are killed,
and as a rule not more than two or at most three are actually
reared.<a id='r124'></a><a href='#f124' class='c014'><sup>[124]</sup></a> Among the Melanesians the custom of infanticide
is very common. “It must also be assumed,” said Ratzel,<a id='r125'></a><a href='#f125' class='c014'><sup>[125]</sup></a>
“that in Ugi (Solomon Islands) all the infants are killed, to
be replaced by the Bauros.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not surprising that such a widespread occurrence of
artificial abortion and of infanticide among primitive races
is bringing about a rapid diminution in the numbers of
these, and may lead even to their extinction. This is taking
place in the case of the natives of New South Wales, of
New Guinea, and of the islands of Aaru. Nothing could
show more plainly the feebleness of the human family instinct.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>In more highly civilised nations, the rude proceedings of
savages have been replaced by clever devices to prevent
conception, and infanticide has become rare. Artificial
abortion is excited by modern methods suggested by the
progress of science. The embryonic membranes are pierced
not by the ribs of seals or hair-pins, but by sterilised sounds,
and the operation is performed with strict asepsis. In averting
the natural results of passion the woman is subjected to
the smallest possible risk.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is indubitable that more than one race has perished
because of its lack of the instinct of family. However, it
need not be feared that the human race itself will disappear
because of the failure of procreation. But it is plain that
the readiness with which devices to prevent the production of
children have been adopted shows the weakness of the family
instinct in man, and opens up a problem to which the attention
of moralists and legislators may well be directed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The family instinct is deeply seated, as it arose among
animals more ancient than man; none the less it exhibits
disturbances and aberrations in the human race capable of
bringing about the extinction of peoples or nations. It is,
however, strong enough to secure that man will persist in
the future.</p>

<p class='c007'>Man certainly is a social animal, but the instinct impelling
him towards union with his fellows is of recent origin. Such
animal societies as are to be found among insects are not
comparable with human associations. Among mammals, the
nearest allies of man, the social instincts are developed only
to a slight extent, and even the anthropoid apes show very
little progress in this direction. Many of these creatures
have shown in captivity the aptitude to become friendly
with man or with other animals, and thus have displayed
the beginnings of the capacity to form societies. But, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>the wild condition, anthropoids live only in families, and
these contain few individuals. As regards the social capacities
of the chimpanzee Dr. Savage wrote:<a id='r126'></a><a href='#f126' class='c014'><sup>[126]</sup></a> “They cannot
be called gregarious, seldom more than five, or ten at most,
being found together. It has been said on good authority
that they occasionally assemble in large numbers in gambols.
My informant asserts that he saw once not less than fifty
so engaged; hooting, screaming, and drumming with sticks
on old logs, which is done in the latter case with equal
facility by the four extremities.”</p>

<p class='c007'>We have little acquaintance with the social life of the
anthropoids, but, so far as we know, these creatures present
only the merest beginnings of the social instinct. Man has
moved much beyond them in that direction. Even the
lowest races and the most primitive of living peoples such
as, for instance, the Bushmen or the aborigines of Australia,
display a well-developed social instinct.<a id='r127'></a><a href='#f127' class='c014'><sup>[127]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The universal presence of the social instinct among human
beings would seem to afford the basis of a happy life. In
the numerous attempts made to find a purely rational
principle that may serve as the basis for morality without
the intervention of supernatural sanction, abundant use has
been made of man’s craving to live in association with his
fellows. Those who have tried to deduce moral law from
the essential constitution of man have relied largely upon
the innate sympathy between man and his fellows. Such
a line of argument is so common and has been employed so
frequently that I need not spend much space in developing
it. I shall limit myself to a few examples.</p>

<p class='c007'>Towards the end of last century Büchner,<a id='r128'></a><a href='#f128' class='c014'><sup>[128]</sup></a> a German
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>physician, published a materialistic code of morality that
made a considerable sensation. He wrote as follows on the
question now before us: “What we term the moral sense
arose from the social instincts and habits which, under pain of
extinction, are developed in every society of men and animals.
Morality depends on sociability, and varies with the
peculiar conditions of each particular association. As man
is essentially a social animal, and to be regarded, apart from
society, merely as a wild beast, it is plain that the needs of
the community must impose on him certain restrictions and
directions that in time will pass into a settled code of morals.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Half a century later practically the same idea was
repeated. Haeckel,<a id='r129'></a><a href='#f129' class='c014'><sup>[129]</sup></a> the well-known German naturalist,
expressed it as follows in a volume that appeared a few
years ago:—</p>

<p class='c007'>“Modern science shows that the feeling of duty does not
rest on an illusory ‘categorical imperative,’ but on the solid
ground of social instinct, as we find it in the case of all the
social animals. It regards as the highest aim of all morality
the re-establishment of a sound harmony between egoism
and altruism, between self-love and the love of one’s neighbour....
If a man desire to have the advantage of living
in an organised community he has to consult not only his
own fortune but also that of the society and of the ‘neighbours’
who form the society. He must realise that its
prosperity is his own prosperity, and that it cannot suffer
without his own injury. This fundamental law of society
is so simple and so inevitable that one cannot understand
how it can be contradicted in theory or in practice; and
yet that is done to-day and has been done for thousands
of years.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>The sexual and family instincts may be satisfied in many
different ways, and this is also the case with the social
instincts. Onanism and perverted passion may satisfy the
sexual instinct; celibacy, artificial abortion and infanticide
exist alongside the love of the wife and the parental cares.
So also the social instinct of a criminal may be satisfied by
his association with other criminals. It is well known that
the most hardened criminals have their own codes, and
they join faithfulness to their own companions to an
atrocious attitude towards the rest of the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is not enough then merely to give scope to the social
instincts that we all possess. We have to determine how
far, and towards which of our fellow creatures, we are to
exercise such instincts, and it is here that the difficulty arises
which as yet has not been resolved by religion or rationalism.
Must our social instincts reach to our relatives near or
distant, or to our fellow townsmen, or compatriots, or to all
white men, or to all men, white and black, or to the good
only, or to the good and bad alike? Perhaps we should
limit the operation of the instinct to those of our own
religion, or who share our views of life? The instinctive
feeling is quite silent on these points, and it is precisely on
them that the difficulties arise. It is well known that at
different epochs and in different circumstances very different
answers have been given to such questions. When religion
was predominant, a common faith was a bond transcending
patriotism. Later on, patriotism itself became the dominant
bond. In recent days, a conception of international solidarity
began to appear. Thus, for instance, there was recently a
combination of different nations against China, and nationality
was forgotten. Some of the European nations banded
themselves together and even assumed an Asiatic race in
the union, with the object of punishing a common enemy.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>What was the bond that united nations so different? It
was not religion, for the bond included Catholics and Protestants,
orthodox Christians and Buddhists. Most probably
the bond of union was a community of interest, the
result of similar civilisation and military and political
organisation.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been suggested occasionally that the social instinct,
or human sympathy, for the terms are practically identical,
may stretch further and further and become so widespread
that all the members of the human stock will unite and
act only for the common good. But the problem is complex.
Sympathy, when pushed too far, may become harmful.
Nations have taken part in a campaign, impelled by some
feeling of sympathy, and have brought harm on themselves.
Sympathy extended to criminals and wicked persons is
equally harmful. The social instinct itself must be regulated
for the good of the community which it holds
together.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ought we to extend our sympathy to all humanity, or to
limit it to some particular section? Theorists have spoken
of the solidarity of all humanity, believing it possible to
extend our sympathy to the races furthest removed from
us. In countries in which different races are brought in
contact, very practical difficulties are encountered by the
theorists. In America and in some other countries, for
instance, laws have been passed against the Chinese, excluding
the latter from the consideration granted to other races.
The negro question also is very difficult in those countries
in which the black race dwells amongst whites. In Europe
it has been the custom to condemn the action of civilised
races in taking their land from natives of primitive type.
Sutherland, the author of a striking work on the origin and
development of morality, justifies such arbitrary conduct.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>To the question, “Was it right for the whites to take possession
of the Australian forests of the blacks?” he replied
in the affirmative. “No doubt,” he said, “there is a moral
instinct against it, but the action undoubtedly was right.”<a id='r130'></a><a href='#f130' class='c014'><sup>[130]</sup></a>
In a summary of his conclusions he lays down that moral
conduct is a compromise between the individual and social
instincts that so often are opposed. But he has no more
to say than his predecessors as to the rational basis of the
compromise.</p>

<p class='c007'>The social instinct has been acquired by mankind too
recently, and it is still too feeble, to be a trustworthy guide
in all conduct. To obviate this difficulty, at many different
times, divine sanction has been evoked to control the relations
among men. The categorical law has been formulated
with the same object. Thus by one means or another, some
kind of social order has been kept up. The efficacy of these
additional guides is seen clearly on those rare occasions when
some special combination of circumstances has set people free
from them. Thus at Moscow, in 1812, before the arrival
of the French army restored authority, and lately, after
the eruption in Martinique, the ordinary authority lapsed,
the anti-social instincts of the people were loose, and a clear
idea was given of the inherent weakness of the human social
instinct.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have shown that in man the instinct for choosing food
and the sexual and social instincts are still so weak that it is
impossible to trust to them in the absence of other guidance.
It is as equally necessary to determine what kind of food
is most suitable for men in different conditions of life, and
what means are best fitted to satisfy rationally his sexual
and family instincts. So also it is urgent to determine
exactly the direction and object of the social instinct. For
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>the love of our fellow creatures we should seek the best
ways of making them happy.</p>

<p class='c007'>But what is happiness? Is it the feeling of well-being
experienced by the individual himself, or is it the judgment
of others on his sensations? It is notoriously difficult to
pronounce on the happiness of another. From the outside,
when a man seems to enjoy health, to have a family and
comfortable means of subsistence, we are inclined to call him
happy; but the individual himself may have a very different
opinion about himself. It is often impossible to rely
on the judgment of others. On the other hand, the opinion
of an individual himself on his own condition may be equally
fallacious. Very often the feeling of well-being is a symptom
of general paralysis, as may be inferred from the following
quotation: “The patient is well pleased with himself,
and delighted with his constitution and circumstances. He
boasts without ceasing of his robust health, his muscular
strength, the clearness of his complexion and of his general
‘fitness.’ His clothing is magnificent and his residence
palatial. In a more advanced stage of the disease, the
exaggeration becomes extreme. He believes that he is able
to blow down the walls with his breath, or that he could
carry a ton, or drink a hogshead of wine, or that nothing
could tire him out. Then megalomania begins, and the
patients believe themselves in possession of titles, of power,
and wealth. They are members of parliament, noblemen,
princes, generals, kings, emperors, and popes, or God
Himself.”<a id='r131'></a><a href='#f131' class='c014'><sup>[131]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>As general paralysis is a result of syphilis, in order to
make a large number of persons believe themselves thoroughly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>happy, it would be necessary only to spread this disease.
Without lingering on this paradox, I may at least point
out that the problem of happiness, which is associated
intimately with social life, is extremely difficult.</p>

<p class='c007'>The social instinct is equally powerless to solve the
problem of justice in its relation to the general interest of
humanity. It is plain enough that, in the existing condition
of human knowledge, we all inflict and undergo
injustices of different degrees. This misfortune is a consequence
of the disharmony of human nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>From what I have already said, it must be clear that
before we can find a rational guide to direct us in the operation
of our social instinct, we should have to determine
exactly the nature of true happiness for the individual and
of true justice. Then only should we be in a position to
set about making human life as happy as is possible.</p>

<p class='c006'>It is not to be wondered at that man’s social instinct exhibits
so many imperfections and disharmonies, seeing that it is
still in an unsettled condition, and is a recent acquisition.
On the other hand, we should expect to find that love of
life and the instinct of self-preservation had reached a high
degree of harmony, since these have been in process of
development throughout the whole animal series that
culminated in man. Even in the lowest forms of life many
contrivances exist for purposes of protection. Creatures,
the bodies of which are merely microscopic drops of protoplasm,
the living material, may be protected by shells from
external influences which threaten their destruction. Plants
protect themselves, sometimes by means of thorns which
prevent them from being eaten, sometimes by secretions
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>either merely irritant in character or actually poisonous.
Among animals the means employed for self-preservation
are even more numerous. Shields and shells, the secretion
of fluids exhaling unpleasant odours, or facilitating escape by
clouding the water, as in the case of the ink of the cuttlefish,
offensive weapons, strong teeth, and many other characters,
serve no other purpose than to protect the individual life. The
exposition of this subject would involve writing a complete
treatise on the comparative anatomy of plants and animals.</p>

<p class='c007'>Among lower animals the preservation of life is accomplished
without mental connivance, conscious or unconscious.
Soon, however, protective instincts begin to appear.
Simple cases of these are flight at the approach of danger,
protection by a covering of slimy froth secreted by the
creatures themselves, or built up from this excreta, or
from foreign matter. Such facts show that the love of life
and the instinct of self-preservation are almost universal
in the living world.</p>

<p class='c007'>All these devices for the avoidance of danger and escape
from death could have been developed in animals before
these had any distinct idea as to what death was. We
know that some animals can distinguish between living and
dead prey. Some carnivora recognise the smell of dead
bodies. Those which are accustomed to feed on living
creatures refuse all others, detecting the difference by the
absence of movement. As in such cases the idea of death
is imperfect, it is easy to deceive the creatures by offering
carcases artificially set in motion, or living prey rendered
motionless by some means or other. In order to escape
from enemies so readily imposed upon, many insects when
alarmed become motionless and feign death; and that may
be regarded as yet another instance in the category of
natural means for the protection of individual life.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>Moreover, the higher animals, such as mammals, exhibit
a profound ignorance of death, many of them remaining
completely undisturbed in the presence of dead companions,
or even devouring the latter at the risk of contracting a
fatal disease. Rats, for instance, eat the bodies of rats
which have died of plague, and while appeasing their hunger
themselves contract the disease which they transmit to
other animals, particularly to human beings. Unlike those
animals, however, which are indifferent to the death of
their kind, there are others that instinctively shrink at seeing
the dead bodies of their own species. Horses on passing
a dead horse show signs of discomfort, and attempt to
run away. Bullocks when witnessing the slaughter of
others also exhibit evidences of distress and fear. In spite
of these examples, however, it is quite certain that animals,
even those highest in the scale of life, are unconscious of
the inevitability of death, and of the ultimate fate of all
living things. This knowledge is a human acquisition.</p>

<p class='c007'>In man, the instinct of self-preservation is well developed.
Hardly appreciable during infancy, it manifests itself in a
marked degree in young children. At the sight of a human
corpse, children become panic-stricken, as though confronted
by a wild beast or snake.</p>

<p class='c007'>In young adults this instinct of self-preservation, which
is closely connected with an instinctive fear of death, is
not fully developed. It often takes some special circumstance
to awaken it, such as a dangerous illness, an
accident, or the perils of war. Young people who while in
good health believe their lives to be in danger, often take it
to heart so as to make themselves really ill. Relating his
impressions during the siege of Sebastopol, Tolstoi, who
at that time was only twenty-six years of age, writes as
follows: “Notwithstanding the distractions offered by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>various and urgent duties, the instinct of self-preservation,
and the longing to quit this horrible place of death was
present in the hearts of all. This desire was equally strong
in all; in those mortally wounded, and in the volunteer
rushing with all his might into the centre of the fray to
open a path for the horse of the general, in the general
himself as he directed and controlled his men. The officer
of marines, in the middle of a battalion in action, crushed
so that he could hardly breathe, felt it equally with
the wounded man carried on a stretcher by four soldiers
until, further progress being impossible, he had been set
down just under the Nicolai battery, or the artilleryman
who had served his gun for sixteen years.” In the normal
course of life, however, the young do not show an instinctive
clinging to life in any marked degree. They often risk
their lives for trifling reasons, and commit all sorts of indiscretions
hurtful to life or health without a thought of the
consequences. They may be inspired by the highest
motives, but they are equally ready to fritter strength away
in the gratification of the lowest appetites. Youth is the
age of disinterested sacrifice, but also of indulgence in all
kinds of excesses, alcoholic, sexual and others. Youths seem
to think that they will always attach the same value to
life, and that between death at thirty years of age and
death at sixty, there is a difference only of time. As their
love of life is indifferently developed, young people are often
extremely exacting, the pleasure they enjoy being but
moderate, whilst the suffering provoked in them by the
slightest annoyance is intense. They consequently become
epicureans in the lowest sense of the word, or else abandon
themselves to exaggerated pessimism.</p>

<p class='c007'>“<span lang="la">Edite, bibite, post mortem nulla voluptas</span>” was the
motto of German students, greedy for pleasure, and unknowing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>that a love of life develops with age in every human
being. On the other hand, in order to keep the balance
between joy and sorrow, youth, true to its instincts, undervalues
the former and exaggerates the latter, thus arriving
at a pessimistic view of life, and declaring that existence
is a misfortune in itself. It is significant that Schopenhauer
published his theory of pessimism at the age of thirty-one.
His successor, R. Hartmann, when twenty-six years old, proclaimed
that human existence is an evil which one should
get rid of at all costs. Optimistic theories, on the other
hand, have been set forth either by persons advanced in
years or by persons whom special circumstances have caused
to appreciate the joy of living. As a counterbalance to the
pessimism of German philosophers, Duhring formulated a
theory of optimism in his book “Der <a id='t117'></a>Wert  des Lebens,” but
was himself blind at the time. Sir John Lubbock published
some years ago a book entitled “The Pleasures of Life,”
which opens with the following sentence: “Life is a great
gift.” His attitude towards life is entirely opposed to that
of the pessimists, but then he formulated it at the age of
fifty-three.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has long been recognised that the old attach a higher
value to life than do the young. J. J. Rousseau, for instance,
says: “Life becomes dearer to us as its joys pass away.
The old cling to it more closely than the young.”<a id='r132'></a><a href='#f132' class='c014'><sup>[132]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>This reflection is absolutely correct, and is proved by a
number of facts. I once knew very intimately a scientific
man who had passed a very unhappy youth. Being hypersensitive
to pain, he tried to assuage it by every means in
his power. Some trifling annoyance sufficing to throw him
into a state of utter prostration, he was in the habit of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>resorting to the aid of narcotics. In order to escape from
mental anguish he inoculated himself with poisons. By
the time he had arrived at an advanced age his hypersensitiveness
gave place to feelings much less acute. He
ceased to resent the ills of life so bitterly as he did in his
youth; while he came to appreciate better the positive side
of life, and even in moments of unhappiness he did not
contemplate putting an end to his existence.</p>

<p class='c007'>In youth he was pessimistic, and insisted upon the preponderance
of evil over good. As he became older, his
attitude towards existence became entirely modified.</p>

<p class='c007'>I do not say, however, that it is necessary to be old in
order to realise the misfortune of death. “He who pretends
to face death without fear is a liar,” said J. J. Rousseau.
“That all men fear to die is the great law dominating the
thinking world, and without which all living things would
soon cease to exist. This fear is a natural impulse, and is
not merely an accident but an important factor in the whole
order of things.”<a id='r133'></a><a href='#f133' class='c014'><sup>[133]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>One often hears people express their indifference to death,
but an examination into their real feelings on the subject
soon shows the true state of affairs. I once happened to be
present when a lady, already well advanced in years, expressed
a wish for death, and said that she had no fear of
it whatever. On acquiring a fuller knowledge of her case,
I recognised that she was seriously ill, and that she regarded
death as the only possible termination to her sufferings.
As soon as she found that recovery was possible, she manifested
intense delight at the prospect of a prolonged life
freed from incessant pain.</p>

<p class='c007'>Instinctive love of life, and fear of death, which is only
a manifestation of the former, are of an importance in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>study of human nature impossible to over-estimate; it is
therefore necessary to consider a few instances throwing
light upon the subject. Even the ancients were interested
in the problem. The subject is perhaps as well dealt
with in a Buddhist legend as anywhere.<a id='r134'></a><a href='#f134' class='c014'><sup>[134]</sup></a> “The young
Prince Çakya-Mouni, the founder of the Buddhist faith,
being desirous of discovering the true meaning of life,
expressed a wish to leave the world and devote himself to
a religious life. In order to turn him from his purpose, his
father built him a magnificent palace, wherein he could
indulge in every sort of pleasure, and in which he would be
protected from all sorrow. Under this system he never saw
old people, nor those who were diseased, nor the dead. In
spite of being thus strictly guarded, the young prince often
contrived to escape into the outer world in order to drive
about. During his first drive, he met a broken-down,
decrepid old man, with varicose veins, decayed teeth, a
wrinkled skin, and grey hair, bent double with age like
the roof of a house, leaning upon a stick; all traces of youth
had departed from him, only inarticulate words came from
his throat, his procumbent body resting on the stick,
and his limbs and every part of them trembling.” Having
learnt from his coachman that this was an old man, and
that “in all living creatures age creeps upon youth,” that
every one came to it and that “there was no way out of
it,” the prince was so deeply impressed that he said to his
coachman, “What a misfortune to be a weak foolish person,
whose intelligence, blinded by the pride of youth, sees nothing
of old age. Turn round my chariot. I would return. What
are games and pleasures to me whose body is the future
dwelling-place of old age?” Another time Çakya-Mouni
met on the road a man consumed by fever, his body weakened,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>his breathing difficult. Informed by his coachman that the
man was suffering from disease, the young prince exclaimed;
“Health, then, is a mere dream, and the fear of disease
takes a terrible form. What wise man, having seen such
a phase of human existence, could continue to be gay and
happy?” Shortly after Çakya-Mouni went out for the
third time, and “saw a dead man placed on a bier covered
by a pall, surrounded by his relations, all weeping, lamenting,
wailing, their hair disordered, placing dust upon
their heads, and beating their breasts.” The violent emotion
produced by the sight of the dead man caused the
prince to say to himself: “Woe to youth threatened with
old age! Woe to health, the prey of every kind of disease!
Woe to the life of man which lasts but a little while! Woe
to the attractions of pleasure which seduce the hearts of
the wise.” These reflections of Çakya-Mouni are the basis
upon which Buddhism is founded, and that religious philosophy
is impregnated with pessimistic doctrines relating to
human life.</p>

<p class='c007'>Modern pessimists hold views resembling Buddhism.
Schopenhauer from early youth was engrossed by the great
problems of human life. His mother, in a letter to him<a id='r135'></a><a href='#f135' class='c014'><sup>[135]</sup></a>
reproached him with “grumbling at the inevitable,” which
shows that at twenty-seven years of age he had revolted
against the idea of death. The problem of mortality was
one of those in which he was most deeply interested, and
his fear of disease and death was such that he left Berlin at
the first outbreak of cholera in 1831 (influenced by the death
of Hegel, who succumbed to the disease), and went to live at
Frankfort, a town unvisited by the epidemic. He affirms<a id='r136'></a><a href='#f136' class='c014'><sup>[136]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>that “the greatest, and generally speaking the worst, misfortune
that can befall any one is to die, and there is no fear
equal to the fear of death.” It was the impossibility of escape
that suggested to him the idea of a pessimistic philosophy.</p>

<p class='c007'>The literatures as well as the philosophies of all periods
have dealt with the problem of death. Edmond de Goncourt
tells in his “Journal” how, in conversation with his
friends, this question was always recurring. The following
is an account of one of these conversations:<a id='r137'></a><a href='#f137' class='c014'><sup>[137]</sup></a> “Our old
established dinner of five took place to-day. Flaubert was
missing, so there were only Tourguéneff, Zola, Daudet, and
me. The ethical ennui of some of us, the physical sufferings
of the others, led the conversation to death, which we discussed
until eleven o’clock, sometimes passing to other
subjects, but always coming back to the gloomy topic.
Daudet declared that in his case it was an obsession, <em>a
poisoning of his life</em>, and that he never moved into a new
house without looking round for the place where his coffin
would come to lie. Zola told us that his mother had died
at Médan, and that, as the staircase proved too narrow,
the coffin had had to be lowered from a window; he declared
that he never looked at that window without wondering who
would be taken out that way next, he or his wife. “Yes,”
he said, “ever since that day death has always been in the
background of our thoughts, and very often during the
night, looking at my sleepless wife, I feel that like me she is
thinking of it, and we lie quietly without saying aloud
what is in our minds—for shame, yes, for very shame—<em>Oh!
it is terrible, that thought—and the terror of it becomes
visible!</em> There have been nights when I have leapt suddenly
out of bed, and held myself for a second or two in a state
of abject terror.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>Jean Finot<a id='r138'></a><a href='#f138' class='c014'><sup>[138]</sup></a> was told in confidence by E. de Goncourt
that if he could banish the thought of death from his mind
life would be relieved of an almost intolerable burden. Jean
Finot also relates that in the course of a memorable evening
spent with Victor Hugo at the house of the latter, nearly
all of the distinguished persons who were present, when
questioned as to their ideas on the subject of death, frankly
admitted that the thought of it inspired them with fear and
sadness. Amongst modern authors Count Léon Tolstoi
has dealt most with the problem of death. In many of his
works whole pages of memorable reflections on the subject are
to be found, but the most harrowing and terrible picture he
ever painted is contained in his “Confessions.”<a id='r139'></a><a href='#f139' class='c014'><sup>[139]</sup></a> The reader
will pardon my propensity for quoting passages relating to
death. He will recall the account of the Siege of Sebastopol
already quoted by me, in which every one was described as
fearing death when faced by danger; but this fear, as the
author was a young man of twenty-six, was not wholly
absorbing.</p>

<p class='c007'>Shortly before he attained his fiftieth year, Tolstoi became
bitterly tormented by the thought of death. He describes
the beginning of this mental crisis in the following words:
“First there came moments of perplexity, of arrest of vital
force, as though I had lost the power of living and moving;
I felt utterly lost, and fell into a state of complete dejection.
This passed away, however, and I continued to live on as
before. Before long the moments of perplexity became
more frequent; the arrest of my living energies was always
manifested by a renewal of the same questions, ‘Why? and
What comes after?’”<a id='r140'></a><a href='#f140' class='c014'><sup>[140]</sup></a> For some time Tolstoi did not pay
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>much attention to his mental condition, but by degrees he
began to analyse it, and reached the following conclusion:
“The fact is that life is a blind alley. I had lived, worked
and marched onward, and had arrived at the edge of an
abyss, and nothing remained to me but to fall into it. And
yet I could neither stop nor retrace my footsteps, nor shut
my eyes in order not to see suffering and inevitable death.
It was a void, a complete annihilation.”<a id='r141'></a><a href='#f141' class='c014'><sup>[141]</sup></a> “In this condition
I felt that I must cease to live, and, fearing death,
I had to employ various ruses to prevent myself from
taking my life.”<a id='r142'></a><a href='#f142' class='c014'><sup>[142]</sup></a> “I could attach no reasonable meaning
to any action of my life. I was merely astonished to think
I had failed to realise the position from the beginning. All
that, I said to myself, must have been patent to all the
world long ago. If not to-day, then to-morrow, disease
and death—they are already here—will attack elderly
persons—me—and there will remain only corruption and
worms. My deeds, whatever they may be, will be forgotten
sooner or later, and I shall be no more. Why then take
pains about anything? How a man can know all this and
yet go on living amazes me. One can only go on living just
so long as one is intoxicated with life; once sober, however,
one cannot fail to see what an idiotic fraud it all is. It is
also true that there is nothing even amusing or intelligent
about it; it is simply stupid and cruel and nothing more.”
Seeing no way out of this, Tolstoi turned his reflections on
family love: “My family&#160;... I say to myself&#160;... but
then my family, my wife, and children are also merely human
beings! They live under the same conditions as I myself.
They have the choice between living a lie or facing the
horrible truth. Why then should they live at all? Why
should I love, cherish, and protect them? In order that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>they may experience the same despair, or that they may
go through life like idiots? Loving them, I cannot conceal
the truth from them; every step forward in knowledge
leads to this truth; and the truth is death.”<a id='r143'></a><a href='#f143' class='c014'><sup>[143]</sup></a> To conclude
this series of quotations, which must have given the
reader some idea of the love of life and the fear of death,
I shall give one more example, taken, not from the pen of
a master but from daily life.<a id='r144'></a><a href='#f144' class='c014'><sup>[144]</sup></a> It refers to the death in the
Christian community of a “minister of God, who was pious
as a S. Francis of Assisi, candid as a young girl, of a rigid
asceticism, and renowned for his charity.” Logically speaking,
the death of such a man should have been peaceful.
Had he been a fictitious character, his author would not have
described his death except in the conventional fashion.
This is what really occurred, according to the letters of an
intimate friend of the dying man, who wrote as follows:
“Our poor friend is fighting death inch by inch in a way
that is positively tragic. He who was so full of resignation,
so serene, so perfectly at peace with his own soul, <em>is terrified
by the approach of death</em>. It is a <em>horrible sight</em>, that moves
one to tears. We are powerless not only to afford him
physical relief but to console the terrible anguish which
assails the clear intellect that clings so desperately to life,
and which death will claim while fully alive. ‘I could still,’
he cried, ‘give a course of lectures on theology or political
economy, and I must die.... It is terrible to be fully conscious....
How much better it would be if I could not
think!... And what is it that we ask of God? Eternal
happiness! It is just as if one of your workpeople came
and asked you for a thousand francs for a day’s work!’
You would answer him, ‘What nonsense you talk, you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>must be mad, my friend!’ <em>It is hard to die.</em> I confess
to you, my friend, that this makes one reconsider religion
and philosophy.... The goodness of God is not what we
think&#160;... <em>there is a mystery over us</em>.... Is death then
truly the King of Terrors for those who have led good
lives?”</p>

<p class='c007'>What is this love of life which makes death so terrible?
It is a very interesting question, and Tolstoi himself has
published an essay on “the fear of death.”<a id='r145'></a><a href='#f145' class='c014'><sup>[145]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>He tries to prove that the feeling arises from a false conception
of life. “Those who fear death,” he says, “fear
it because it seems an empty darkness, but the darkness
and emptiness present themselves merely because they have
a false conception of life.”<a id='r146'></a><a href='#f146' class='c014'><sup>[146]</sup></a> According to Tolstoi man
should have no greater fear of death than of any of the
other changes to which it is subjected by life. “No one
is afraid of falling asleep,” he says, “and yet the phenomena
of sleep are like those of death—there is the same
loss of consciousness. Man does not fear sleep, although the
arrest of consciousness is as complete as in death.”<a id='r147'></a><a href='#f147' class='c014'><sup>[147]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Tolstoi thinks that the fear of death is a superstition,
and that it disappears when we see life as it is.<a id='r148'></a><a href='#f148' class='c014'><sup>[148]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Tokarsky,<a id='r149'></a><a href='#f149' class='c014'><sup>[149]</sup></a> another Russian writer, a few years ago published
a treatise on the fear of death, and tried to show
how little reason there was for it. The writer was a physician
for the insane, and knew himself to be afflicted with
an incurable and fatal disease. His observations on the
fear of death were probably based on his own feelings.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>Judging from the evidence of a number of persons who had
been in mortal danger, Tokarsky declared that death had
no terror, and that it was unnecessary to fear it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tokarsky’s theory was supported in recent years by
Finot<a id='r150'></a><a href='#f150' class='c014'><sup>[150]</sup></a> whose arguments in its favour were similar to those
of his predecessor. He held that man himself created the
fear of death, and that the prospect of an unknown future
played a considerable part in it. “Beyond that which we
see,” says Finot, “there is always something that we cannot
see, and it is the invisible that we fear.”<a id='r151'></a><a href='#f151' class='c014'><sup>[151]</sup></a> The idea that
death is generally attended by pain seems to Finot quite
erroneous, and he comes to the conclusion that “our ignorances
and prejudices are responsible for the creation of this
superstition, so terrible to contemplate, so far removed
from the truth.”<a id='r152'></a><a href='#f152' class='c014'><sup>[152]</sup></a> Instances which have occurred of people
threatened with death and suddenly restored to life, give
proofs, according to Finot, that death, far from being painful,
is attended by pleasant sensations. With regard to this,
Heim, a Swiss savant, says that tourists who have had
serious falls while mountaineering, and have been so near to
death that they experienced all the premonitory symptoms,
felt above all a sensation of ecstasy.</p>

<p class='c007'>It cannot be denied that some forms of death are pleasant,
but it is no less certain that in many other cases, and these
too the majority—the sensation of approaching death is,
on the contrary, extremely painful. This question, however,
is not necessarily connected with the fear of death
that may come to those who are not yet about to die. But
it is precisely the latter mode of fear that is so important
a factor in human life. Men who are dying of starvation
do not feel painfully hungry at the moment of death. The
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>actual pain of hunger lasts only for a limited period,
probably, in the case of man, only about twenty hours,
after which it is succeeded by a condition of lassitude and
general weakness, which however is different from painful
hunger. The fear of death is similar, for in certain cases it
does not last up to the end of life. The pain of thirst, on
the other hand, is much more persistent, lasting up to
the end.</p>

<p class='c007'>Finot discussed the instinctiveness of the fear of death.
“The question,” he wrote, “is important. For if the fear
be instinctive, it is independent of our will and not to be
controlled by reason. It would then break out in every
case at the approach of death. Now the evidence of many
persons who have no more than escaped mortal danger is
clearly against the view.”<a id='r153'></a><a href='#f153' class='c014'><sup>[153]</sup></a> Hunger is certainly instinctive,
and yet is not always felt when the body is exhausted by
want of food or menaced by death from starvation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Closer investigation leaves no doubt but that the fear of
death is truly an instinct. In some of the higher animals
it exhibits itself in the same fashion as other instincts. The
intimate friend, whom I have already mentioned, was for
years in constant expectation of death, and faced its approach
with perfect calmness. Believing that he had played his part
in life to the best of his power, not only did he think it quite
natural that he should cease to live, but he regarded the
possibility of a decrepid and painful old age with the greatest
possible repugnance. In his case, neither reason nor desire
led to a fear of death. When, however, it was definitely
diagnosed that he suffered from a disease which might prove
fatal, there was aroused in him a certain sensation which
must have been the fear of death. Analysis of Tolstoi’s
statements in his “Confessions” makes it clear that his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>sensations on reflecting that he too would cease to be, and
that there would be left only corruption and worms, were
no other than the instinctive fear of death, a fear that his
reason was powerless to control. To follow Tolstoi in
telling any one that the fear of death is a form of superstition
which must be subdued by the intelligence, is no better than
to attempt to console a woman about to undergo ovariotomy
by telling her that as in future she will be unable to bear
children she ought to subdue her sexual instincts. She will
find out that her desire is not under control of the will but
is a pure instinct.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fear of death has long been recognised as an instinct.
Schopenhauer,<a id='r154'></a><a href='#f154' class='c014'><sup>[154]</sup></a> for instance, interpreted it in that way.
According to him, “from the point of view of intelligence
there is no ground for fearing death. Reason, which is the
outcome of knowledge, does not present death to us as an evil.
It is certainly not the rational, conscious part of ourselves
which fears death; the <em>fuga mortis</em> which pervades all living
beings is an emanation of the blind will.” This “blind
will” is no other than a pure instinct which is independent
of our rational will.</p>

<p class='c007'>I need not pursue the subject, but I may recall that Lord
Byron came to the conclusion that the fear of death is an
instinctive manifestation of the soul. In “Cain” he
expressed this view sufficiently clearly:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in26'>I live,</div>
      <div class='line'>But live to die; and living, see nothing</div>
      <div class='line'>To make death hateful, save an <em>innate clinging</em>,</div>
      <div class='line'>A loathsome, and yet all <em>invincible</em></div>
      <div class='line'><em>Instinct of life</em>, which I abhor, as I</div>
      <div class='line'>Despise myself, yet cannot overcome—</div>
      <div class='line'>And so I live.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>Later on in the same poem Byron makes Cain say of his
father Adam:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in20'>Ere he plucked</div>
      <div class='line'>The knowledge, he was ignorant of death.</div>
      <div class='line'>Alas, I scarcely now know what it is;</div>
      <div class='line'>And yet I fear it, fear I know not what.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It is then indubitable that among the instincts of man
there is one which loves life and fears death. This instinct
develops slowly and progressively with age. In that respect
it is astonishingly different from other instincts. When
hunger or thirst or sexual desire is gratified a sensation of
satisfaction is experienced, and this readily passes into satiety
or even indifference. The mood lasts for a certain time,
and then the instinctive needs reawaken. The instinct of
life, however, behaves very differently. In most human
beings it develops slowly and becomes stronger and stronger
as the years pass by. In childhood and early youth we are
very anxious to “grow up,” but when we are adult we have
no desire to grow old. We are greatly disturbed by the
appearance of wrinkles and grey hair. Instead of being
glad to have finished a great part of our mortal career, we
feel sad at being nearer the inevitable end. Old age, as
it usually presents itself, is marked by ugly features, and
often by repugnant or even horrible characters. Little
children are usually terrified by the appearance of very old
persons, and it is a familiar nursery threat to send for an
old man.</p>

<p class='c007'>The murder of the aged is a custom widespread amongst
the lower races. The natives of Fiji bury their old men
alive, on the pretext that they have become utterly useless.
The custom is in existence throughout Melanesia, and occurs
in New Caledonia and in most of the adjacent Polynesian
islands. Old age is universally despised in that part of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>world. The natives of Australia respect old people so long
as they retain their activity, but once they become unable
to take care of themselves they are abandoned. Often
they are killed and eaten, and this custom is favoured by
their religious beliefs.<a id='r155'></a><a href='#f155' class='c014'><sup>[155]</sup></a> The ancient inhabitants of Germany,
according to the investigations of Grimm, “killed the old
and the sick, and often buried them alive.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The modern civilised world has certainly made considerable
progress. The old are no longer killed; they are tolerated,
and accorded liberty to commit suicide. In many countries
work is often refused to the old on the plea that they are
not strong enough for it, and at the same time they are
refused admission to almshouses on the pretext that they
are not yet old enough. Dealing with the question of the
average life and of the normal life, Paul Bert<a id='r156'></a><a href='#f156' class='c014'><sup>[156]</sup></a> expressed
himself with regard to the aged as follows: “They deserve
congratulations, care and consideration, <em>but the prolongation
of their lives does not demand any special solicitude from
society</em>.”</p>

<p class='c007'>However, in spite of the characters of old age which make
it horrible and useless, and at best no more than to be tolerated,
and in spite of the physical and intellectual weakness that
accompany it, the instinctive love of life is preserved in the
aged in its strongest form. To make quite certain about this
I have visited almshouses for the aged, and it was easy to
see that all the inmates hoped that their days might be prolonged.
In a Home occupied by fairly well-educated
persons, I discovered that one and all felt as if they were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>continually being threatened by death, as if they were
convicts awaiting the day of execution. At the Salpêtrière,
where there are a number of very old women,
septuagenarians are regarded almost as young girls. The
great ambition of women of eighty is to live to one hundred,
and the desire to live is almost universal.</p>

<p class='c007'>This seems a contradiction of another fact demonstrated
by statistics, that age increases the frequency of suicide.
It is certain that more old men commit suicide than young
men, but on careful inquiry into the statistics of the subject,
it becomes evident that the chief incentive to suicide
does not lie in the cessation of the will to live, but in the
difficulties experienced by old people of earning a living,
and in the frequent presence of disease in the aged.
Deprived of the means of existence, refused the shelter of
charitable institutions, old men are apt to fall back upon
a rope or the fumes of charcoal. Statistics relating to the
suicide of the aged show that the greatest number of victims
belong to the poorer classes. The suicide of rich old men
is generally prompted by the presence of incurable disease.
There is, however, need for much wider inquiry into the
subject. It would be interesting, for instance, to obtain
more detailed information regarding the motives which
urge the old to put an end to themselves. In recent times
the suicide of Max von Pettenkofer aroused public attention.
After a distinguished scientific career, he resigned his post
of Professor at the University of Munich at the age of seventy-six.
He went to live a little way outside the town on a property
where he devoted himself to gardening and other
country pursuits. Although a sufferer from diabetes, his
intellect remained unimpaired, but he became a prey to
extreme melancholy, owing to the death of some friends to
whom he was greatly attached. Moreover, during the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>latter part of his life he suffered from a septic affection of
the neck. This disease, not fatal in itself, was the indirect
cause of Pettenkofer’s death, which occurred by suicide at
the age of eighty-three. The <em>post-mortem</em> examination<a id='r157'></a><a href='#f157' class='c014'><sup>[157]</sup></a>
showed a fairly well preserved organic system, healthy,
with the exception of chronic inflammation of the membranes
of the brain and atheroma of the cerebral arteries.
The circumstances relating to this particular case of suicide
are unusually well known, and yet there are many obscure
points about it which are of the highest importance. The
chronic meningitis from which the aged scientist suffered
conclusively precluded the theory that the motives which
led him to commit suicide were prompted by the phenomena
of normal life. On the other hand, instances are not wanting
of old men of good education and refined surroundings who
cling tenaciously to life, even at a much more advanced
age than the Munich professor.</p>

<p class='c007'>The instinctive love of life resembles the sexual instinct
in a great many women. Just as the love of life goes on
increasing when the best of life is past, sexual pleasure
is often unfelt by women until their beauty is already
faded.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another character common to the love of life and the
sexual instinct is that they both persist throughout old
age, although they can no longer be satisfied.</p>

<p class='c007'>Edmond de Goncourt relates in his diary that at his
réunions of literary celebrities (Zola, Daudet, and Tourgéneff),
the conversation turned most frequently upon
the subjects of love, life and women. “Death or love,
strangely enough,” says Edmond de Goncourt, “are always
what we talk about after dinner.”<a id='r158'></a><a href='#f158' class='c014'><sup>[158]</sup></a> Old age was even then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>knocking at the doors of the distinguished writers mentioned,
and so it is quite natural that their interest should
have been wholly absorbed by the two instincts which
exhibit such enigmatic and paradoxical tenacity.</p>

<p class='c007'>We saw in the preceding chapter how disharmonious is
the sexual instinct which often only develops at, and nearly
always persists until, a period of life when its normal and
regular functional activity is no longer possible. We saw,
too, the ill resulting from this disharmony in the reproductive
apparatus. The ill, however, although serious, only
amounts in that case to an inconvenience which can be
endured.</p>

<p class='c007'>Far worse is the disharmony of the instinctive love of
life which manifests itself when death is felt to be near at
hand. It is then incomprehensible and particularly terrible,
and humanity, from time immemorial, has sought the key
to the tragic puzzle, and tried by all the means in its power
to unravel the mystery. The religions of all times have
been concerned with the problem. “Religion,” says
Guyau,<a id='r159'></a><a href='#f159' class='c014'><sup>[159]</sup></a> “consists for the most part of meditation upon
death. If we had not to die there would probably
be still more superstitions among men, but there would
probably be no systematised superstitions nor religions.”
Philosophy also has tried to solve the question of death.
Some ancient philosophers held the opinion that philosophy
is only a meditation upon death. Socrates and Cicero<a id='r160'></a><a href='#f160' class='c014'><sup>[160]</sup></a>
have well said that “the life of a philosopher is a continual
meditation upon death.” In our own day Schopenhauer
developed the same theory. “Death,” he said,<a id='r161'></a><a href='#f161' class='c014'><sup>[161]</sup></a> “is the
real inspiring genius of philosophy.... Without death it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>is doubtful if philosophy would exist at all. It is therefore
quite natural that a special essay on Death should preface
the last, the most serious, and the most important of my
books.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Judging from the facts set forth in the last three chapters,
there can be no doubt but that the human constitution,
although in many ways perfect and sublime, exhibits
numerous and serious disharmonies, which are the
source of all our troubles. Not being so well adapted to
the conditions of life as orchids are, for example, in the
matter of their fertilisation by the mediation of insects,
or the burrowing wasps for the protection of their young,
humanity resembles rather those insects the instinct of
which guides them towards the flame which burns their
wings.</p>

<p class='c007'>Even at a time when humanity had attained no definite
knowledge of itself, a vague suspicion prevailed as to the
existence of disharmonies, and an effort was made to remedy
the evil. The following chapters will show what man has
done with a view to remedying the natural disharmonies
of his constitution.</p>

</div>

<p class='c008'>Animism as the foundation of primitive religions—The
Jewish religion in relation to the doctrine of immortality
of the soul—The religions of China—Ancestor-worship in
Confucianism—The conception of immortality in Taoism—The
persistence of the soul in the Buddhist religion—The

ills arising from the disharmonies of the human constitution</p>

<p class='c006'>Humanity did not await the discovery by science of the
existence of disharmonies before trying to find remedies for
them. The will to live, to preserve health, to satisfy the
instincts and to make them act in unison, have driven
mankind, in the very earliest days of reflection, to invent
remedies for the imperfection of the human constitution.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have shown that, even in the case of animals, the instinct
as to choice of food does not save them from certain harmful
substances. Man himself has for long recognised that this
instinct of his is no safe guide, and has tried to discover
surer methods of distinguishing between substances that are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>useful as foods and substances that may cause disease or
death. The best wisdom of primitive man must have been
given to the observation of the effects of substances which
had been eaten, and to a consequent framing of dietary
rules.</p>

<p class='c007'>The reproductive functions, in the same way, must have
attracted the notice of man in very early times, as he must
have found the harm that came from a blind following
of instinctive desire.</p>

<p class='c007'>Above all other reasons, man must have been impelled
by his instinctive love of life and fear of death to find some
way out of his dangerous situation. To preserve his life,
man must have sought wise choice of food and control of
sexuality.</p>

<p class='c007'>Since the dawn of intelligence, man has tried to judge the
unknown from the analogies given by what he knows best,
that is to say, by his own self. Thus he came to attribute
to everything around him qualities like his own qualities,
and motives like his own motives. He came to think not
only that all living beings were possessed of will and intelligence,
but that inanimate things conducted themselves like
human beings.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such a primitive idea is the basis of what Tylor has called
“Animism,” the foundation of the philosophy and religion
of savage and civilised man alike. When a man was seen
to die, it was plain that he did not entirely disappear, but
merely became transformed into a new condition. The dead
body was not alive as we are, but, none the less, it was
alive in a fashion of its own. This was the answer to the
desire for the preservation of life, to the fear of death, that
is to say, of total extinction. It is practically identical with
faith in immortality and a future life.</p>

<p class='c007'>The animistic conception is almost world wide. It is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>plain that it afforded the most efficacious palliative for
minds revolting against the inevitability of death, and that
it harmonised with our intense will to live. “Such child-like
ignoring of death,” wrote Tylor,<a id='r162'></a><a href='#f162' class='c014'><sup>[162]</sup></a> “such child-like make-believe,
that the dead can still do as heretofore, may well
have led the savage to bury with his kinsman the weapons,
clothes, and ornaments that he used in life, to try to feed
the corpse, to put a cigar in the mouth of the skull before
its final burial, to lay playthings in the infant’s grave.
But one thought beyond would carry this dim blind fancy
into the range of logical reasoning. Granted that the man
is dead, and his soul gone out of him, then the way to provide
that departed soul with food or clothes or weapons is
to bury or burn them with the body.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is needless to recapitulate the various animistic customs
which were in vogue among primitive peoples, and which
have left marked traces amongst nearly if not all civilised
races. The details may be found in the works of
several authors, notably Tylor, Lubbock, and Waitz-Gerland.<a id='r163'></a><a href='#f163' class='c014'><sup>[163]</sup></a>
I shall mention only a few, choosing those that
seem most plain. The Turanians of Eastern Asia bury
with their dead all sorts of implements, such as axes and
flints, and food, such as meat and butter, believing that the
departed will have need of these during the long voyage
in the land of the spirits. A Tasmanian, on being asked
why spears were buried with the dead, replied, as if the
answer were self-evident, “Of course for the use in combat
of him who has fallen asleep.” The Greenlanders place
bows and other weapons in the tombs of their men, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>knives, needles, and other instruments for sewing are buried
with their women, in the full belief that such objects will
be useful in the other world. In the Congo region, the
curious custom exists of leaving a hole in the grave over
the mouth of the dead body, and once a month passing
into this hole meat and drink.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many races are not content to place merely inanimate
objects in the graves. The Caribbeans, believing that
the human spirit after death is carried to the kingdom of
dead souls, sacrifice slaves on the tombs of their chiefs,
in order that the latter may be attended in the next world.
With the same object they bury dogs and weapons. The
negroes of the Gold Coast, at the funeral of a great man,
kill women and slaves that he may be provided for in the
next world. Moreover, they bury with him his finest
apparel, his gilded fetishes, and corals and pearls, so that
the dead man may continue to make use of them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tylor states that such animistic conceptions occur amongst
all savages without exception. According to Herbert
Spencer, if we take groups of the human race, such as tribes,
societies, and nations, we find abundant evidence that all,
or nearly all, have a belief, vague or clear, in the resurrection
of a double of the dead man. It has been suggested that
the origin of this widespread belief is the image of the
departed that comes to us in dreams. These images are
taken as real visits of the dead.</p>

<p class='c007'>In civilised races there are numerous relics of the old
beliefs. The Spaniards set bread and wine on the graves
of their relatives on the anniversaries of their deaths.
The Bulgarians hold a feast of the dead on Palm Sunday.
They eat and drink well, and then leave the remains of
the banquet on the graves of their relatives that these may
consume them in the night.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>Saint-Foix<a id='r164'></a><a href='#f164' class='c014'><sup>[164]</sup></a> relates that when Bertrand du Guesclin was
buried at St. Denis, in 1389, several horses were sacrificed.
The Bishop of Auxerre first blessed them, laying his hands
on their heads, and then they were killed. At Treves, in
1781, at the burial of General Frederic Casimir, his horse,
according to the custom of the Teutonic Order, was led in
front of the bier, and when the General had been laid in
the tomb, the horse was killed and buried with him.<a id='r165'></a><a href='#f165' class='c014'><sup>[165]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Although the sacrifice of men and animals is no longer
made by civilised peoples at burials, many funeral customs
have an obviously animistic origin. In Russia, for instance,
rice is placed alongside the corpse, and pine branches are
strewed along the way to be traversed by the procession.
The wreaths of “immortelles,” used so largely at funerals
by the modern French, have an extremely ancient origin.
They were employed by the Romans, and probably their
use implied a conception of a future life in a region where
plants and flowers grew.</p>

<p class='c007'>The belief in life after death, so widespread in the world,
has been the foundation of all religions. I cannot follow
this question here as closely as it deserves. To investigate
it elaborately would take more space than this volume
affords, and more knowledge than I possess. However,
it is important to my argument to insist that, among races
that have inhabited very different parts of the earth, that
have had very different manners and have passed through
different stages of civilisation, the conviction has been strong
that death is not the end of all, but only a door leading from
one kind of existence to another. Because of the high importance
of the existence of this conviction, however, I must
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>discuss some of the criticisms that have been made as to its
universality.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been asserted repeatedly that the idea of a future
life was not a part of the Jewish religion, as formulated
in the Bible. Haeckel has recently repeated a common
opinion that belief in the immortality of the soul was absent
from the oldest and purest form of the Jewish religion.
“There is not to be found,” he said, “either in the Pentateuch
or in those more ancient parts of the Old Testament
which were written before the Babylonian captivity, any
idea of the persistence of the human soul.” This is true
only within limits. No doubt the books of Moses contain
no reference to a future life nor to heaven and hell in the
sense of modern creeds, but it is no less true that the ancient
Jews shared with other races the conception of a survival
after death. “Like almost all primitive nations,” wrote
Renan,<a id='r166'></a><a href='#f166' class='c014'><sup>[166]</sup></a> “the Hebrews believed in a kind of double personality,
in a shadow pale and thin which, after death,
descended underground and passed a sad and colourless
existence in the sombre halls of the dead. The dead
dwelt there, without feeling, or knowledge, or memory,
in a world without light, abandoned by God. At the most
the old Hebrews hoped to obtain for themselves a quiet
resting-place, a pleasant couch for the time when they would
be with the dead. It comforted them to picture themselves
as lying amongst their ancestors in quiet communion.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Ancestor-worship, which is associated closely with the
idea of a future life, appears repeatedly in the Pentateuch.
Jacob, when he felt death coming upon him, called his son
Joseph and said unto him, “Bury me not, I pray thee, in
Egypt; but I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry
me out of Egypt, and bury me in their burying-place.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>According to Chantepie de la Saussaye,<a id='r167'></a><a href='#f167' class='c014'><sup>[167]</sup></a> “we are coming
to recognise more and more how strongly the children of
Israel, and in fact all other peoples, were tinged with
animism and ancestor-worship.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is very remarkable how the idea of a future life, which
was vague in the early days of Israel, grew more and more
clear. Ezekiel (sixth century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>), when he had “seen the
visions of God,” prophesied of things to come, and declared
that God would breathe life into the dry bones of the dead.
The Book of Daniel (second century <span class='fss'>B.C.</span>) expressed the same
idea in a stronger fashion: “And many of them that
sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting
life and some to shame and everlasting contempt”
(Daniel xii. 2). “It is plain,” said Renan,<a id='r168'></a><a href='#f168' class='c014'><sup>[168]</sup></a> after quoting
these words, “that Israel had now reached the last stage in
the secular development of her ideas, and had reached the
conception of the kingdom of God, as synonymous with the
future world and the resurrection. As the conception of
a soul distinct from the body was foreign to her, she could
not conceive of a future life apart from resurrection of
the body.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Still later, in the Talmud, the conception of a future life
is clothed with details. Paradise is depicted as a region
filled with sweet odours, while hell is an unclean place,
thick with mire and smoke. According to the Talmud, in
the life beyond the grave, “there is neither eating nor drinking;
the good sit there with crowns on their heads and see
God in bliss.”<a id='r169'></a><a href='#f169' class='c014'><sup>[169]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>At the date of the Cabalistic philosophy, the Jews had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>embraced the doctrine of transmigration of souls, and had
come to believe that the spirit of Adam had entered David
and would pass on to the Messiah. Some human souls
passed into the bodies of animals, into the leaves of trees,
or even into stones.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is plain that the idea of a future life was a part of
the Jewish religion.</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been said, also, that the idea of a future life was
absent from the religions of the Chinese. Büchner,<a id='r170'></a><a href='#f170' class='c014'><sup>[170]</sup></a> for
instance, who came to be almost the official representative of
the materialism of the second half of last century, asserts that
“Buddhism, that famous religion, the most widespread and
one of the most ancient, which counts among its followers
nearly a third of the inhabitants of the earth, ignores completely
the immortality of the soul.” Haeckel, also, in
the “Riddle of the Universe,” a volume that sums up the
materialism of the end of the last century, makes a similar
statement. “The higher oriental religions include no belief
whatever in the immortality of the soul; it is not found
in Buddhism, the religion that dominates 30 per cent.
of the entire human race; it is not found in the ancient
popular religion of the Chinese, nor in the reformed religion
of Confucius which succeeded it.”<a id='r171'></a><a href='#f171' class='c014'><sup>[171]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>This question demands a somewhat closer investigation.
It has been thoroughly proved that the basis of the ancient
religion of the Chinese was no more than an extreme development
of ancestor-worship. Every important event in family
affairs was accomplished “in the presence of the ancestors.”
It was a bond with relatives beyond the grave. As in
other cases of animism and ancestor-worship, meats were
offered to the dead, and objects were buried with them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>to be of service to them. According to A. Réville,<a id='r172'></a><a href='#f172' class='c014'><sup>[172]</sup></a> the
Chinese as a whole “fully recognised the conception of
personal survival after death; if there were no other reason
for stating this, it would be enough to point out that offerings
of real food would be incomprehensible, if made to persons
supposed to be non-existent or reduced to complete unconsciousness.”
As they offer to the dead, food and clothing
and precious things, it is plain that the Chinese think of
life beyond the grave as not very different from this life.
“The dead maintain their interest in the affairs and persons
and food that was familiar to them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As the idea of immortality became developed further,
the Chinese modified their customs. Instead of offering to
the dead material objects, as is still done by many peoples,
they came to substitute emblems. “Houses and clothing
and food imitated in paper, and dolls of paper and straw
to represent slaves, are burned, so that the spiritual forms
of these objects may be offered to the spirit they wish to
honour.”<a id='r173'></a><a href='#f173' class='c014'><sup>[173]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>One of the chief motives of ancestor-worship is fear lest
the dead, if neglected, may visit their wrath on the living
by sending plagues and pestilence upon them.<a id='r174'></a><a href='#f174' class='c014'><sup>[174]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The worship of the dead had laid hold of the Chinese so
firmly that even Confucius, notwithstanding his intelligence
and scepticism, paid it a large tribute. “Confucius
the philosopher,” said Réville, “regarded it as a duty to
offer to his ancestors the gifts of food that princes had sent
to him desiring to honour him.”<a id='r175'></a><a href='#f175' class='c014'><sup>[175]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>Confucius and his followers were reticent and ambiguous
in their references to a future life, but that attitude did
not prevent them from “observing the customs and ceremonies
as carefully as if they had had a confident faith in
the immortality of the soul.”<a id='r176'></a><a href='#f176' class='c014'><sup>[176]</sup></a> Although Lao-tseu himself
believed neither in heaven nor hell, and professed the most
rationalistic views, his disciples none the less accepted the
doctrine of immortality, and even came to believe in rewards
and punishments after death.</p>

<p class='c007'>The followers of Lao-tseu, the Taoists, devoted themselves
specially to the problem of immortality. They made
efforts to discover an elixir that would be capable of prolonging
earthly life to eternity. “One of the chief claims
of Taoism,” wrote Réville, “was the possession of a specific
against death. It was true that they admitted this to be
not only very difficult to obtain, but still more difficult to
employ. However, if certain rules were observed strictly
they were at least confident of great prolongation of life.
It was only the very few Taoists who had reached perfection
who could hope to pass into the better world without
being subjected to the pains of death.”<a id='r177'></a><a href='#f177' class='c014'><sup>[177]</sup></a> “And so some of
the masters of Taoism, such, for instance, as Chang-Tao-Ling,
ascended to heaven without dying, by climbing a
lofty peak and vanishing into the skies.”<a id='r178'></a><a href='#f178' class='c014'><sup>[178]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The ordinary Taoists accepted fully the idea of immortality.
They “taught the doctrine of purgatory for those who
were not evil. To arrive at this, Lao-tseu simply expanded
and applied to mankind generally an idea that was already
familiar to him, the conception of the transmigration of
one soul through several successive bodies. By means of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>such expiatory transformations, a man who had not reached
it directly through the holiness of his life, could attain the
immortality of genii and the blessed.”<a id='r179'></a><a href='#f179' class='c014'><sup>[179]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It was believed for long that the Taoists, following the
teaching of their master, did not recognise a hell. But
this opinion has had to be abandoned, because the “Taoist
clergy have provided, in the temples dedicated to the tutelary
deities of their cities, paintings illustrating the torments prepared
for the guilty by the ten courts of justice that sit in
the depths of an ocean hidden in the interior of the earth.”<a id='r180'></a><a href='#f180' class='c014'><sup>[180]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Clearly then, many Chinese, both Taoists and followers
of Confucius, believe in the existence of a world beyond the
grave. However, the denial of immortality has been
ascribed to Buddhists in particular.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buddha accepted the Brahmanist doctrine of transmigration
of the soul. This has been established clearly on
the evidence of several documents of admitted authenticity.
Orthodox Buddhism is somewhat vague on the immortality
of the soul. Buddha himself avoided making a decisive
statement on this matter. In such circumstances “those
who were terrified at annihilation, and who could not give
up the hope of eternal happiness, interpreted the silence of
Buddha according to their own desire, and inferred that he
did not forbid them to hope.”<a id='r181'></a><a href='#f181' class='c014'><sup>[181]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>There are many instances of the evasions of Buddhist
teachers when they were pressed with this disturbing question.
Pasénadi, the king, once met Khémâ, the nun, a
disciple of Buddha, renowned for her wisdom. The king
put to her the following question: “Does the Perfect One
(Buddha) exist after death?” “The Sublime One, O
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>great king, has not revealed to us the existence of paradise
beyond the grave.” “Then the Perfect One exists no longer
now that he is dead, O reverend lady?” “Neither, O
king, has the Sublime One revealed that He who is perfect
does not exist now that He is dead.” “Am I to believe, then,
O reverend lady, that the Perfect One still lives, although
He is dead, and at the same time does not live? Am I to
believe, O wise lady, that the Perfect One being dead,
neither exists nor does not exist?”<a id='r182'></a><a href='#f182' class='c014'><sup>[182]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Take again the mode in which Soumirmitá,<a id='r183'></a><a href='#f183' class='c014'><sup>[183]</sup></a> “the son of
a god, and surrounded and preceded by a crowd of gods,”
worshipped Bouddha (Tathâgata): “Thou art the physician,
skilful to save, and who givest the gift of life everlasting.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Buddhists, as they were not given clear doctrines on
this subject, very naturally followed their inclinations by
accepting the idea of life beyond the grave. And certainly
Buddhism does not teach annihilation of the body after
death, although this has been lightly taken for granted.
On the contrary, it is so persuaded of survival after death
as being the rule, that it grants only to rare and elect souls
the privilege of at length laying down the burden of continuous
life.<a id='r184'></a><a href='#f184' class='c014'><sup>[184]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The Chinese Buddhists retained the fundamental conceptions
of the ancient religion of their land and continued to
worship their ancestors and to seek the readiest path to
immortality. They soon came to transform Nirvâna into
paradise, and to inculcate in the Chinese race the doctrine
of future rewards and punishments. “The Buddhist monasteries
in China for the most part possessed a set of little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>rooms, in which there were depicted, in vivid colours,
crowded scenes from the eighteen hells of tribulation
and lamentation. For there exist under the earth
eight hells filled with the torments of fire, and ten with
the equally terrible horrors of ice.”<a id='r185'></a><a href='#f185' class='c014'><sup>[185]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The paradise of the Chinese Buddhists, or Ni-pan (Land of
the Pure), is a region abounding in “gold and silver, and
precious stones. Rivers of crystal run on golden sands
covered with splendid lotus-flowers and traversed by
delightful paths. Lovely music is always to be heard.
Three times a day a shower of blossoms falls. There are
to be seen there gorgeous birds, pheasants, and parrots,
and many others; and these, every quarter of an hour, in
a choir of melodious voices, trill out the beauties of religion
and recall to their hearers the Buddha, Dharma, and Sungha.
These are some of the wonders prepared for those who are
born again after death. Into that land neither sin nor
any evil enters.”<a id='r186'></a><a href='#f186' class='c014'><sup>[186]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>I need no longer accumulate details to show the falseness
of the view that a third of humanity profess materialism
to the exclusion of any belief in survival after death. On
the other hand, it is quite certain that the vast majority
of mankind is convinced that death puts no definite term
to existence, and that this life is no more than a passing
stage leading to a life to come. However, although many
simple races believe that the future life is merely a continuation
of this life, the more subtle-minded races present the
future life as filled with delights for the good and with
torments for the wicked.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such an idea of the next world, which is very generally
accepted, is probably the basis of religions. From it have
come the conceptions of supreme beings and divinities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>Many facts go to show that the primitive gods were no other
than the relatives and ancestors of the living, now dead,
yet living in another world and ruling the affairs of this
world. Wicked ancestors became transformed into evil
spirits, while good ancestors became mild and benevolent
deities.</p>

<p class='c007'>Very many peoples offer prayers to their ancestors and
treat them as gods. The Kaffirs pray and sacrifice to their
dead relatives, believing that the spirits of the dead haunt
their late dwelling-places, and, according to their characters,
help or torment their descendants. As they are able to
cause good or evil after death, these play the part of gods.
But, as Lubbock points out (“Origin of Civilisation”),
it must be remembered that the god of a savage is only
a being like unto himself, although probably rather more
powerful, and I shall show that there are many intermediate
stages between true gods and mere dead parents whose malice
is to be feared, or whose kindness is to be supplicated.</p>

<p class='c007'>The North American Indians<a id='r187'></a><a href='#f187' class='c014'><sup>[187]</sup></a> pray to the spirits of
their forefathers for good weather or luck in hunting, and
fancy when an Indian falls into the fire that the ancestral
spirits pushed him in to punish neglect of the customary
gifts, while the natives of Louisiana are said to have even
gone so far as to build temples for dead men. In Polynesia
“at Tanna, the gods are spirits of departed ancestors, aged
chiefs becoming deities after death, presiding over the growth
of yams and fruit-trees, and receiving from the islanders
prayer and offerings of first fruits.”<a id='r188'></a><a href='#f188' class='c014'><sup>[188]</sup></a> In the Malay Islands
“the souls of deceased ancestors are looked to for prosperity
in life and help in distress.” In Africa ancestor-worship
is well developed. The Zulu warriors, “aided by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>the amatongo,’ the spirits of their ancestors, conquer in
the battle. Even the little children and old women, of
small account in life, become at death spirits having much
power, the infants for kindness, the crones for malice. But
it is especially the head of each family who receives the
worship of his kin.”<a id='r189'></a><a href='#f189' class='c014'><sup>[189]</sup></a> The Zulu adores his father, when
he is a chief, above all others, and is convinced that a father
remembering his love for his children, will not forget them
when he is dead. “The Zulu follows up the doctrine of
divine ancestors till he reaches a first ancestor of man and
creator of the world, the primeval Unkulunkulu.”<a id='r190'></a><a href='#f190' class='c014'><sup>[190]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>So great is the number of instances that it is too difficult
to choose from them. The fundamental idea is always
identical, although details and accessories vary, as one passes
from the hardly idealised relatives of negro tribes and goes
progressively to the “Father Almighty, Maker of heaven
and earth” of the Nicene Creed.</p>

<p class='c007'>The conception of a future life in the form of immortality
or some kindred state, associated with the conception of
many gods or of one God, has been developed to satisfy the
craving for life and to combat the fear of death, that is to
say, to defeat the greatest contradiction in the constitution
of man. I must now inquire how far the different religions
have been successful in this object.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many primitive races have absolute faith in the tenets
of their religion, and believe in the promise of life beyond
the grave as in a certain fact. Thus the aborigines of the
Fiji islands are convinced that they will be born again, in
another world, in the exact condition in which they leave
this life; and so they wish to die before being afflicted
with any infirmity. As it is very difficult to reach old age
without being the victim of some illness or infirmity, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>a man feels the approach of age, he tells his children that
the time has come for him to die. If he himself fails to
give this notice, the children undertake the duty. A family
council is called, the day is appointed, and the grave made
ready. The old man is allowed to choose between being
strangled and being buried alive. The following instance
will show the strength of a belief in life to come. Hunt,
an English traveller, quoted by Lubbock, received a visit
from a young native of Fiji, whose purpose was to give an
invitation to the funeral of his mother which was to take
place next day. Mr. Hunt accepted the invitation and
joined the procession, but as he was surprised to see no dead
body, inquired about it from the son. The son pointed out
his mother, walking in the procession and as gay and animated
as any of the others. Mr. Hunt stated his surprise,
and asked why he had been deceived by being told that the
mother was dead, when she was plainly as much alive and
as well as any one else. He received the reply that the
death festival was about to be celebrated; that presently
they would bury her; that she was old, and that his brother
and he, thinking that she had lived long enough, and should
be put to death, had obtained her cheerful consent.</p>

<p class='c007'>This case is far from being solitary, because many villages
have been described as containing no inhabitants of a greater
age than forty years, all those older having been buried. It
is not difficult to understand that death should have no
terrors for persons possessed of a faith as strong as this.
The American Indian, according to Lubbock, has very little
fear of death. He does not fear transference to a realm
in which, as he has been told all his life, there is no sorrow
and abundance of joy.</p>

<p class='c007'>I know a case of a young girl of the Catholic faith who
believed so firmly in the joys of Paradise that, when stricken
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>with a mortal illness, she awaited death with a great impatience.
Before she died, she cried out that “already she
could see the beautiful flowers and hear the sweet music of
the birds that fill heaven.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But it is rare to find faith so strong in such a case. More
often faith is not strong enough to subdue the fear of death,
and in proof of this I may recall the instance of the clergyman
already given.<a id='r191'></a><a href='#f191' class='c014'><sup>[191]</sup></a> Stricken with an incurable disease,
he, in spite of his religion, underwent extreme agony,
and could not reconcile himself to the idea of death. The
fear of death showed itself so strongly in this case that I
have chosen it as a characteristic instance of the feeling.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is only with fanatics and simple or primitive persons
that blind faith can subdue this instinctive fear. For this
reason, since the most ancient times, religions have sought
out something more than the promise of paradise to mitigate
this chief disharmony of our nature. In this connection
the doctrines of Buddha are those most interesting. Here
I shall not deal with that modified and transformed Buddhism,
in which, as I have already shown, there was a return
to the doctrine of future life, with its hell of torments and
heaven filled with delights.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buddha made no reference to the great blot on human
life. His doctrine, in its original form, was extremely
pessimistic. Take, for instance, some of his sayings on this
subject: “Miserable in truth is this world, in which there
is beginning, birth, growing old, death, disappearance and
renewal. But we know not how to escape from this world,
full of horror though it be. Alas, because of old age, illness,
death, and their like, we know not who shall put an end
to this world, which is so full of horror. To all who are,
there comes old age, and illness, and death, and their like.”<a id='r192'></a><a href='#f192' class='c014'><sup>[192]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>When the Buddha came upon the sorrows of the world,
as I have already described (p. <a href='#Page_119'>119</a>), he reflected as follows:
“Woe upon youth, threatened by old age! Woe upon
health, which so many maladies destroy! Woe upon the
life of man, which lasts but a little space! Woe on the
temptations of the flesh, which lure the heart of the wise!
Would that there were neither old age nor illness, nor
death and the pains of death, which come from the five
elements of life (Skandhas)! Would that there were neither
old age nor illness nor death, which are for ever bound up
together! Nevertheless, when I return again I shall consider
deliverance.”<a id='r193'></a><a href='#f193' class='c014'><sup>[193]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Having pondered for many days on these problems,
Buddha thought that he had discovered the only solution,
and taught men resignation. When a man was young he
would ask of his father: “Lord, would that old age would
never come upon me, and that I should keep for ever the
warm colour of my youth; that I should be always filled
with health, and that no disease should come near me; that
my life should be prolonged for ever, and that death should
pass me by! Such an one later on must learn to give up
these longings.”<a id='r194'></a><a href='#f194' class='c014'><sup>[194]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In his famous “Sermon at Benares,” Buddha gave in
brief the outlines of his doctrines in the following words:
“Hear, oh monks! the holy truth of the springs of sorrow!
Sorrow is born of lust of life, that drags us from incarnation
to incarnation, and of pleasure and desire, which seek their
fulfilment hither and thither; the lust of pleasure, the lust
of life, the lust of power. Hear, oh monks! the holy truth
of the conquest of sorrow; it is the killing of this lust by
the utter abandonment of desire, the giving up of all desire,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>the forgetting of all desire, the freeing of the body of all
desire, until there is no place left for desire.”<a id='r195'></a><a href='#f195' class='c014'><sup>[195]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In such a spirit of resignation, Buddha became himself
a monk, and lived according to the strict rules of the pure
life that he himself had laid down (“the belief pure, the will
pure, the language pure, the deeds pure, the means of livelihood
pure, the study pure, the attention pure, the meditation
pure”). However, he did not find many kindred
souls to follow the same precepts. Buddhism soon moved
away from these original tenets, and became a religious
doctrine of the ordinary kind.</p>

<p class='c007'>We are inclined to associate with Buddhism the doctrine
of Nirvâna, as if the latter were the goal to which human
life should be directed. Many philosophers, and the pessimists
chief among them, naturally with Schopenhauer
at their head, have adopted Nirvâna as the goal of mankind,
as they see the world. However, the word Nirvâna has
had many interpretations put upon it, the which is less
surprising as Sanscrit scholars differ. I do not intend to
join in the discussion, as I myself am not acquainted with
Sanscrit, upon which the argument must be founded. However,
I cannot pass it by without comment on the pretext
that it has not yet been settled definitely by specialists,
as it is the case that many thinkers regard Nirvâna as the
goal of human existence.</p>

<p class='c007'>For long Nirvâna was represented as a sort of blank, in
which there was no display of any mental operations. Max
Müller,<a id='r196'></a><a href='#f196' class='c014'><sup>[196]</sup></a> the celebrated Oxford professor, opposed this
interpretation on the ground that, according to him, in
“all passages of Buddhistic origin in which Nirvâna occurs
there is nothing to betoken annihilation. Most of these
passages, if not all of them, would be quite unintelligible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>if we were to replace in them the word Nirvâna by the word
annihilation.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Many other specialists share this view, and cannot agree
that the goal of human life was to be annihilation. Rhys
Davids, for instance, thinks that Nirvâna is to be interpreted
as a tranquillity of the soul, possible of achievement in this
life, and that the word is best translated by the term “sanctity.”
According to him, Nirvâna does not mean extinction
or annihilation, but rather freedom from the great
passions, such as envy and hate. Pfungst<a id='r197'></a><a href='#f197' class='c014'><sup>[197]</sup></a> agrees with
Max Müller; he is convinced that the first adepts of Buddha
could not have conceived of Nirvâna as extinction. Dahlmann<a id='r198'></a><a href='#f198' class='c014'><sup>[198]</sup></a>
on the other hand, tries to prove that Nirvâna
in its primitive signification implied the abolition of the
will to live, and really corresponded to annihilation.</p>

<p class='c007'>I must add, however, that Nirvâna did not occupy a
place in Buddhism so important as has been ascribed to
it by several commentators. In many of the Buddhist
authorities mention of Nirvâna is only accidental. In the
“Lalita Vistara,” for instance, the word occurs very seldom,
and then only in unimportant connections. However, the
latter document contains a good deal that serves to explain
the conception of Nirvâna.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the young Buddha, still very exacting, asked his
father to obtain for him perpetual youth, health, life everlasting,
and freedom from death, he added the following
words: “Lord, if you cannot give me these four gifts, at
least bring it about that after this life I shall have no more
metempsychoses.”<a id='r199'></a><a href='#f199' class='c014'><sup>[199]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>As I have already stated, Buddhism had embraced the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>Brahmanistic doctrine of transmigration of souls. According
to the legend, before his birth as a prince, the Buddha
had passed hundreds of earlier existences. His soul had
been the soul not only of fifty-eight kings, but of eighteen
monkeys, four horses, four snakes, three lizards, two fish,
and of other creatures.<a id='r200'></a><a href='#f200' class='c014'><sup>[200]</sup></a> Such continual transferences of the
soul to so many different animals was a source of perplexity
and sorrow to believers. It was natural that a great thinker
like Buddha should have conceived the desire of sparing
himself and his faithful followers so many transmigrations.
He thought of these rebirths as a great evil, from which a
pure life might set one free.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the poetical language of the Hindoo Buddhists, metempsychosis
was compared to the ocean; the waves that change
from moment to moment were the continual rebirths; our
temporary body was the foam of the crests of the waves,
while Nirvâna was the opposite shore. He who reaches
Nirvâna would never again plunge into the great sea of
Sangsâra. In a passage quoted by Rhys Davids, and
ascribed to Kâma Sutta, it is stated expressly that “the
sea is an image of the Sangsâra or transmigrations, while
Nirvâna is an island upon it. Once the shores have been
reached, a soul will no longer be plunged in the waves of
the ocean, and will be freed from the successive births of
metempsychosis.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In other words, to avoid being tormented after death by
perpetual rebirths, some of which may be humiliating, it
is necessary to live a pure life and so to secure repose or
Nirvâna. Nirvâna is by no means the cessation of all consciousness,
but merely the end of transmigrations. From
such a point of view, it is possible to interpret all, or at least
nearly all, the passages in which Nirvâna is spoken of.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>When he was old and full of disease and afflicted with
grievous pain, Buddha, being at the point of death, thought
of his disciples and called them to him and said: “It is not
meet that I should enter Nirvâna without having spoken
with those who have cared for me, without speaking to the
community of disciples. By the force of my will I shall
subdue this disease and hold the life within me.” Some
time afterwards, the reverend Ananda went to Buddha
and spoke to him, saying amongst other words as follows:
“The Sublime One will surely not enter into Nirvâna ere
he has made known unto the community of disciples his
wishes regarding them.” “Growing more and more feeble,
the spirit of Buddha passed from ecstacy to ecstacy without
ceasing, and knew every delight; then he entered into
Nirvâna. And the earth trembled, and thunder rolled
across the skies.”<a id='r201'></a><a href='#f201' class='c014'><sup>[201]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It is clear that in this passage Nirvâna was associated
with death. But it was with the death of a saint who had
lived a pure life. Metempsychosis would not be inflicted
on him, and he would enjoy repose. It is probable that
the term Nirvâna later on came to be applied to the state
of mind of a saint who, by living the pure life, would avoid
transmigration after death.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the importance of Nirvâna lies in its contrast with
metempsychosis, it is easy to see why the precise state of
mind involved in it has not been described exactly. However,
a survey of the Buddhistic writings makes it plain
that at least Nirvâna was not associated with annihilation.
In this respect Max Müller’s verdict must be taken as correct.</p>

<p class='c007'>Buddha’s attempt to remedy the ills of human life, then,
lay in a complete renunciation of all the joys and pleasures
of life, and in perfect resignation. The mere fact that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>primitive Buddhism did not persist, but rapidly passed into
an ordinary religion, is sufficient proof that Buddha did not
achieve his purpose. It was the promise of a life to come
that attracted so many men and spread Buddhism over
so large a part of the earth. However, this faith has been
able to maintain itself only in certain strata of society to
which the rationalistic conception of the mental processes
has not penetrated. Since the awakening of the scientific
spirit in Europe, it has been recognised that the promise
of a future life has no basis of fact to support it. The modern
study of the functions of the mind has shown beyond all
question that these are dependent on the functions of the
body, in particular of those of the central nervous system. A
slight lowering of the rate of the circulation of the blood, a
fleeting anæmia of the brain, at once arrests consciousness,
that is to say, the fundamental sensation of the individual
mental life. Anæsthetics, used in doses so small that they
do not influence certain parts of the nervous system, as, for
instance, those that control the heart and lungs, completely
abolish consciousness. Persons who are put under chloroform
for surgical purposes fall into a state of absolute unconsciousness.
Sometimes, after undergoing painful sensations,
especially sensations of oppression, the patients imagine
themselves to be in rapid motion, and in a few moments
have the sensation of falling into an immense gulf, after
which comes nothingness, the annihilation of sensations and
of consciousness. In other cases, patients, without any
sensation of catastrophe, lose all idea of reality, and every
psychic and sensorial function is abolished. Such states
are very closely similar to death, which indeed is the result,
in certain rare instances, of the ordinary process of being
chloroformed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Neither the narcosis produced by chloroform nor that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>produced by any other form of anæsthetic, affords any
particle of ground for the view that there is consciousness
in any form apart from the body. The action of morphine
sometimes brings about a strange current of happiness and
an apparent weightlessness of the body; but here again
there is no suspicion given as to the existence of any mental
phenomena apart from the body.</p>

<p class='c007'>Consciousness of personality is of supreme interest
from the point of view of personal immortality, and this
mental phenomenon develops only slowly and progressively
in an infant. This fact, again, like the facts of narcosis,
shows the dependence of consciousness on the action of the
bodily organs. Just as our consciousness comes out of
nothing in the first months, or years, of our life, so it will
pass into nothing at the end of our life.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mental disease confirms this conclusion, and it, too, gives
no ground for the belief in a survival of the mind after
death.</p>

<p class='c007'>Certain internal sensibilities in the depths of our organism
survive our personal consciousness. When the heart has
ceased to beat, and when the anæmic brain is certainly
incapable of personal consciousness, some portions of the
body may still retain vitality. The muscular fibres are still
able to contract when they are stimulated, and the white
corpuscles of the blood can still exhibit their specific movements.
It is certain, moreover, that these white corpuscles
possess a specific sensibility, and, by a sort of sense of taste,
respond to the kind of environment that surrounds them.
Our consciousness, however, is absolutely out of touch with
the sensations of these globules, which, however, none the
less are part of our organism. It happens, therefore, that
in certain diseases, the white corpuscles, stimulated by
the presence of particular substances, perform extensive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>movements of migration within our bodies. Such migration
is quite outside the sphere of consciousness. The corpuscles,
directed by their sensibility, are in constant pursuit of
microbes that have entered the body, and yet these actions,
too, are not made known to our consciousness. In the same
fashion, the thousands of active spermatozoa in the male
organs and the ova in the female possess specific sensibility.
These reproductive elements contain the germ of
individual consciousness, but it is not until they have
developed into the new generation that it is possible to
impute to them individual consciousness, and the organism
that shelters them has no idea of what it harbours. The
sensibility of the white corpuscles and of the many other
cells composing our body, although certainly a reality, has
no part in the absolutely special sensation that we call individual
consciousness, and which is all we think of in wishing
to escape death.</p>

<p class='c007'>The idea of a future life is supported by not a single fact,
while there is much evidence against it. The phenomenon
of intercommunication across a distance, sometimes called
telepathy, may be actual, but affords no support to the
conception of the existence of souls apart from bodies. It
may be that emanations are given off by certain organs,
and that these are capable of being appreciated by the organs
of another body at a distance; but, even if such were the
case, we should have to deal simply with other bodily
functions. Moreover, the supposed phenomena that fall
within this category are so rare, so difficult to observe, and
so obscure, that no certain argument for the continuance
of existence after death can be deduced from them.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is easy to see why the advance of knowledge has
diminished the number of believers in the persistence of
consciousness after death, and that complete annihilation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>at death is the conception accepted by the vast majority
of enlightened persons.</p>

<p class='c007'>Apart from their chief function of consoling men for the
inevitability of death, religions have concerned themselves
with some of the results of other disharmonies of the human
constitution. From time immemorial they have claimed
the direction of diet, the control of the reproductive functions
and the prevention or cure of all kinds of disease.</p>

<p class='c007'>The dietary regulations given by the religions are familiar.
Even at the present day, the cookery of many races is
regulated by their religion. The Jewish diet, notably, is
regulated by the Mosaic law, down to the most minute
detail. For instance, it was forbidden to eat the blood
of animals. Moses commanded: “Notwithstanding, thou
mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy gates, whatsoever thy
soul lusteth after, according to the blessing of the Lord
thy God, which he hath given thee; the unclean and the
clean may eat thereof, as of the roebuck, and as of the
hart. Only ye shall not eat the blood; ye shall pour it
on the earth as water.”<a id='r202'></a><a href='#f202' class='c014'><sup>[202]</sup></a> Later on: “Only be sure
that thou eat not the blood; for the blood is the life;
and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh.”<a id='r203'></a><a href='#f203' class='c014'><sup>[203]</sup></a> “Thou
shalt not eat it, that it may go well with thee, and
with thy children after thee, when thou shalt do that which
is right in the sight of the Lord.”<a id='r204'></a><a href='#f204' class='c014'><sup>[204]</sup></a> The Books of Moses
also contain receipts for the cooking of certain meats.
“Eat not of it raw, nor sodden at all with water, but roast
with fire, his head with his legs, and with the purtenance
thereof.”<a id='r205'></a><a href='#f205' class='c014'><sup>[205]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It has been suggested that these rules were founded on
ideas of hygiene in consonance with the results of modern
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>science. Some of them, it is true, such as the prohibition
of uncooked or partially cooked meat, are confirmed by our
modern knowledge. But the greater number of the Mosaic
rules, as, for instance, the prohibition of the consumption
as food of blood or the flesh of pigs or hares and so forth,
are in direct opposition to a modern knowledge of hygienic
diet. Religious cookery has no more than a historical
interest.</p>

<p class='c007'>The religions have been greatly occupied with the functions
of the reproductive organs. Most of the founders of
the great faiths have paid a keen attention to the disharmonies
of this side of our constitution. They became persuaded
of the merit of abstention, which they practised
themselves and preached to others. Buddha, after devoting
his youth to all the pleasures and not being satisfied, passed
to absolute asceticism. He and his adepts formed an order
of monkhood, on which an absolute celibacy was imposed.
If a member of the order had intercourse with a woman, he
was considered to be as guilty as a murderer or a thief. In
the Buddhist rules framed even for laymen, “sexual intercourse
outside marriage was forbidden, on the ground that
it was degrading.”<a id='r206'></a><a href='#f206' class='c014'><sup>[206]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The views of the Christian religion on sexual matters are
well known. The leaders of Christianity abstained from
sexual intercourse and recommended their conduct to others.
St. Paul more than once affirmed his own continence.
“For I would that all men were even as I myself; but
every man hath his proper gift of God, one after this manner,
and another after that. I say therefore, to the unmarried
and widows, It is good for them if they abide even as I; but
if they cannot contain, let them marry, for it is better to
marry than to burn.”<a id='r207'></a><a href='#f207' class='c014'><sup>[207]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>The religions of savage races are equally concerned with
the reproductive functions. There are many extremely
strange facts known concerning this matter, and among
such I may mention that the Sandwich Islanders have a
deity who presides at abortions. This god is made in the
form of an elongated wooden instrument, and is known as
“Kapo.” The upper part of the deity is shaped into a
grotesque head, while the lower portion terminates in a
point and serves to induce abortion by entering the uterus
and rupturing the fœtal membranes.<a id='r208'></a><a href='#f208' class='c014'><sup>[208]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Many other idols are used by savages as protections
against disease. Ploss-Bartels,<a id='r209'></a><a href='#f209' class='c014'><sup>[209]</sup></a> in his treatise on “Medicine
among Primitive Races,” has described a large collection of
talismans of this kind. The ruling idea in the manufacture
of these is that diseases are due to the presence of evil spirits,
who are to be scared away as soon as possible. The Goldi
of Siberia construct straw or wooden figures of men and
animals to absorb the spirits of diseases. The Guilaks
make wooden human figures, on the breasts of which are
fashioned images of toads. These talismans are used as
remedies for diseases of the chest and stomach.</p>

<p class='c007'>In higher forms of religion there remain abundant traces
of such notions. Even Martin Luther declared that disease
was supernatural in origin. “Behold a matter on which
there is no room for doubt,” he stated, “and that is that
the plague, fevers, and other diseases are the work of the
devil.” A number of religious ceremonies were specified
as the best remedies for diseases.</p>

<p class='c007'>The plague has left many deep marks on human history,
and it is natural that a malady so terrible should have
attracted serious attention. It was usually attributed to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>divine wrath, which was to be appeased by purification and
sacrifice. Human beings were slain on altars to appease
the wrath of God and to lessen the mortality from plague.</p>

<p class='c007'>Such religious customs have disappeared almost completely
with the advancing culture of man, but traces of
them survive and become apparent on occasions. Quite
recently, when the King of England, Edward VII., was
afflicted with an abdominal suppuration, he was given the
assistance of the most highly skilled modern surgery, but
at the same time special services were held in the churches
to aid the cure of the royal invalid.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every one has now come to regard such events as mere
relics of old customs without intrinsic importance. Hygiene
in the kitchen and the prevention of disease are no longer
under the control of religion, but are regulated on scientific
knowledge obtained by the experimental method. I need
pay no further attention to these matters. However, religion
is still occupied with the problem of death. The
solutions which as yet it has offered cannot be regarded as
satisfactory. A future life has no single argument to support
it, and the non-existence of life after death is in consonance
with the whole range of human knowledge. On the other
hand, resignation as preached by Buddha will fail to satisfy
humanity, which has a longing for life, and is overcome by
the thought of the inevitability of death.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was to be expected that in such a state of affairs philosophers
would have sought an issue from the dilemma.
Certainly many philosophical theories have been propounded
to explain life and death. As the subject is of extreme
importance I shall reserve a chapter for it.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>
  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER VIII<br> <span class='c012'>ATTEMPTS IN SYSTEMS OF PHILOSOPHY TO REMEDY THE ILLS ARISING FROM THE DISHARMONIES OF THE HUMAN CONSTITUTION</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Some philosophical systems are in intimate union with
religions—Ideas of ancient philosophers on the immortality
of the soul—The teaching of Plato—The scepticism of
Aristotle—The Stoics—Cicero, Seneca, Marcus Aurelius—Modern
philosophical systems—Pessimism and its origin—Lord
Byron—Theories of Schopenhauer and Hartmann—Mailaender’s
philosophy of deliverance—Criticisms of
pessimism—Max Nordau—Ideas of modern thinkers on
death</p>

<p class='c006'>Systems of philosophy are closely attached to religious
doctrine. Buddhism, for instance, originated in a philosophic
theory which acquired a religious character in the
hands of the followers of Buddha. Similarly, many systems
of philosophy are merely religious dogmas which it has
been attempted to support by rational argument apart
from supernatural revelation.</p>

<p class='c007'>The idea of life beyond the grave has long since furnished
one of the principal bases of various philosophic doctrines,
the ultimate object of which was to solve the problem of
death. Ancient philosophy is full of such. Plato describes
the tragic death of his master Socrates, and in connection
with it expresses very clearly his ideas upon death. He puts
these words in the mouth of Socrates in the “Phaedo”: “Far
from being depressed by the death of a friend, I felt, on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>contrary, that he was to be envied; as I witnessed his
attitude, and listened to his words, and noticed the courage
with which he faced death, I became convinced that he did
not quit this life without some divine support that drew
him towards another world in which he would find the most
perfect happiness man could wish.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Plato attributes to Socrates a very definite view as to
future retribution: “In truth,” said Socrates, “if I did not
expect to find in another life gods at once good and wise,
and men better than those of this life, it would be foolish of
me not to be disturbed by the approach of death. But I
know that I look to finding myself among just men. I do
not fear to die, because I am confident that something still
remains after this life, and that, according to the old belief,
the good will be treated better than the bad.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As such views were not derived from a body of revealed
truth, it was necessary to support them by reasoning.
Plato therefore went on to try to convince us of the immortality
of the soul by speculative hypotheses. He recalled
the Pythagorean doctrine of metempsychosis, and suggested
that the souls who had abandoned themselves to
injustice, tyranny, and plunder would pass into the bodies of
wolves and hawks and falcons, for souls of that nature
could not go elsewhere; while the souls of those who had
practised the social and civic virtues known as temperance
or justice, would inhabit the bodies of peaceful and gentle
creatures such as bees and ants, or would even enter other
human bodies and again become good men.</p>

<p class='c007'>Plato referred also to the law of contrasts in support
of his theory. “As the most strong often springs from
the feeblest, or the most swift from the slow, so life gives
rise to death, and from death life springs.” “From that
which is dead,” said Socrates, “is born all that lives and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>has life. And so our souls after death pass to the infernal
regions.” “As we must grant that the dead are born from the
living as much as the living from the dead, it is plain that
the souls of dead men exist somewhere, whence they may
return to life.”</p>

<p class='c007'>By such arguments Plato tried to prove the immortality
of the soul, the fundamental basis of his philosophy, and
put them in the mouth of his master Socrates on his deathbed.
In the dialogue he tried to refute all kinds of objections.
But, in spite of the assurance with which he formulated
his doctrine, there may be seen underlying the
argument a note of doubt, and it is just this that distinguishes
philosophy from religion.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is evident that the whole of Plato’s system was the
result of an effort to solve the problem of death. Again
and again he said that the true philosopher lived only to
be ready to die; that being so, he declared it to be childish
for men at the last to shrink from what they had so long
been making ready for. It was himself that Plato wished
to convince of a future life. “I do not seek,” he said, “to
persuade all those who are here of the truth of what I say,
although to do so would greatly please me; what I aim at
is to convince myself. Behold me, dear friend, in pursuit
of an argument that, as you see, interests me deeply; if
what I say turns out to be true, it is good to have believed
it, and if there be nothing after death, at least I have gained
this, that while I am still with you, I am not borne down
with grief.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The doubt which was only latent in Plato was much
more active in some other ancient philosophers. Aristotle<a id='r210'></a><a href='#f210' class='c014'><sup>[210]</sup></a>
at one time admitted that part of the soul was immortal,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>but that the other part was mortal. The two parts came
together at the beginning of a life and separated at its
end. Later on, however, Aristotle abandoned this theory
of the immortality of the personal consciousness, and argued
strongly against the Platonic theory of the immortality of
the soul, although, however, he still believed in the indestructibility
of the “rational spirit,” an immortal principle.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Stoics still further developed such a conception.
They held that besides the individual soul there was a
universal soul, a presiding influence in which all others had
their being.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cicero, again, discussing old age and death, tried to establish
belief in a future life. “I am convinced,” said Cicero
to Scipio and Laelius, “that your illustrious fathers, who
were so dear to me, are still full of life, and of the only life
worthy of the name; for the body is, as it were, our prison-house,
within which we must accomplish the tasks laid on us
by necessity. When I think of the activity of the human
spirit, its vast memory, its prevision, its store of art and
knowledge, and experience, I am convinced in the depths
of my being that an existence with such qualities cannot
be mortal. The soul is continually active, and its activity
comes not to it from without; the soul is a self-supporting
activity, and cannot come to an end. Moreover, as the
soul is a simple substance, unalloyed by any mixture of
materials, it can neither be divided nor made to perish.”
By such arguments Cicero sought to prove the immortality
of the soul. “I will tell you,” he said, “why old age,
so far from being grievous to me, is full of delight.” But
in the end, he himself saw the weakness of his proof, and
the note of scepticism appeared in him more strongly than
in his predecessors, so that he came to say as follows:
“If I am deceived as to the immortality of the soul, I am
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>deceived gladly, and I would not have the belief torn from
me while I live. If, when I am dead, all feeling is arrested
within me, as some pretended philosophers hold, at least
I have not to fear that after my death they will come and
mock me for my error.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Scepticism becoming more and more definite, belief in
the immortality of the soul persisted only in the purely
religious form. Philosophical systems freed themselves of
it, and replaced it by a vague form of pantheism.</p>

<p class='c007'>Seneca tried to support the thesis of immortality, but
one gets the impression strongly that there was no vigour
in his belief. He is content with poetry rather than with
reason. “The events of this mortal life,” he wrote in one
of his celebrated “Letters,” “are the mere prelude of a
better and more lasting existence. As our mother’s womb,
bearing us for nine months, shapes us not to live there for
ever, but for our place in this world in which it places us,
with the strength to breathe this air and to withstand surrounding
things: so, also, the time that passes from our
infancy to our old age is a preparation for a second birth.
Another beginning and another world await us. Until
then, we could not endure, save from afar, the splendour
of the heavens. Learn then, O man, to face without a
shudder the decisive hour, the last hour of the body, but not
of the soul. What you see around you consider but as
the furniture of an inn; soon you are going further on.
The day that you dread as your last day is your birthday
into immortality.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In the midst of these glowing visions, however, Seneca
is assailed by dark and gloomy thoughts. “Yes,” he cried,
“all that is must perish; death comes to every living thing.
Every day, every hour, reveals to man the coming of death;
there is always some new lesson to remind him of the fragility
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>he had forgotten, and from a dream of eternity to turn
his thoughts to the grave.”</p>

<p class='c007'>These heights and depths of spirit led Seneca towards a
new theory in which he gave a final expression of his views
on the great problem of human existence. “All beings
pass through definite stages; they must be born, grow and
die. The stars that we see revolving above us, the earth
on which we are carelessly scattered and which seems to us
so solid; all is threatened and all will come to an end.
Old age comes on everything; although the period is very
different, the same end comes to everything. Everything
that now is will cease to be; but for all that the world will
not perish; it will dissolve. Dissolution is destruction for
us. As a matter of fact we think of things only as they
concern ourselves; our degenerate soul, incapable of detaching
itself from the body, sees nothing beyond that; none
the less we should endure the idea of the death of ourselves
and of those near to us with a greater fortitude were we to
realise that nature is a constant routine of birth and death,
that all composite bodies must dissolve, that the dissolved
substances reform, and that the creative power of God
displays itself in this cycle of change throughout the universe.”
From such a final conception of the universe he
draws the consolation: “A great soul should know how
to obey God and submit willingly to the order of the universe.
If it be not for a better life that we are to quit this
life, if not to find a home in the skies more tranquil and
more brilliant, our souls, free from suffering, will return to the
spirit that gave them birth and will mingle in the great all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In other words, abandoning the image of life after death
that played so consoling a part in primitive beliefs, philosophy
became content to advocate resignation to the
inevitable laws of nature, and to console itself with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>promise of a vague return to some universal, eternal
principle.</p>

<p class='c007'>The conceptions of the Stoics, especially in the form
presented by Seneca, found an ardent and brilliant exponent
in Marcus Aurelius, whose “Thoughts” are known to all
the world. He had much to say of the problem of death
and of the attitude of the philosopher towards it. “Death,”
said Marcus Aurelius, “like birth, is one of nature’s mysteries.
In the two are present the same elements: in the
one case in the phase of combination, in the other in that of
dissolution.” In death “there is nothing repugnant to the
essence of an intelligent being, nor to the general plan of
our nature.” But his ideas on death were vague. “Death
may perhaps be a dispersal or resolution into atoms, or
an annihilation in the sense of extinction or deplacement.”
“Alexander of Macedon and his mule-driver were reduced
at death to the same condition, that is to say they returned
alike to the originating principle of the universe, or one
and the other were scattered as atoms.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Although he was definitely a deist, Marcus Aurelius was
undecided as to the immortality of the soul. “If souls have
not disappeared,” he said, “how can the air contain the
eternal generations of them?” “Remember well,” he
said in another place, “that that feeble and composite
creature, your soul, will one day resolve into its atoms;
the faint spark of life will be extinguished, or be assigned
to some other dwelling-place.” Clearly enough, there was
no consoling hope of a future life to be derived from these
halting dubieties. It was needful to replace by some other
anodyne the belief that for so long had brought comfort
to poor humanity.</p>

<p class='c007'>Marcus Aurelius tried to counteract the fear of death
by the following reflection: “To fear death is to fear either
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>being deprived of all feeling or being subjected to some other
kind of feeling. But, if we are deprived of all feeling, we
shall have no evil to fear; if we are to find new kinds of
sensations, our existence will be different, but still existence.”
However, he probably realised the weakness of such a
consolation, for he tried to link the problem of death with
the general principles of human conduct.</p>

<p class='c007'>As I mentioned in the first chapter of this volume, Marcus
Aurelius, like many of the philosophers of antiquity, held
the view that man ought to live according to the dictates
of human nature. The theory recurs again and again
in his “Thoughts.” “The fig tree lives according to its
kind, the dog like the dog, bees like bees, and man like
man.” He expresses this view still more emphatically in
the following words: “Man must live in conformity with
the laws of his nature.” “No one will prevent you from living
according to the laws of nature, and nothing can happen
to you that is not in accordance with nature’s universal
law.” “Neither hand nor foot can do that which is contrary
to the laws of nature, because the foot can only fulfil the
functions of the foot, and the hand those of the hand.
Similarly with man, to behave as a man is not to defy
nature’s laws, because it is only fulfilling the functions of
man. And that which is not against nature cannot be
evil.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Being full of this theory, Marcus Aurelius applied it to death,
which, being a natural phenomenon, was to be accepted
without protest. “For, after all, nature forges the links
and nature breaks them. Is she about to sever them?
Very well, let us then say farewell as if we were taking
leave of our friends, but let there be no tearing of the heart
strings, and let us go willingly, and so avoid being dragged
away. This, too, is in accordance with the laws of nature.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>“Philosophy,” according to Marcus Aurelius, “is to await death
peacefully, and to regard it as merely the dissolution of
the elements which compose the human frame. Such is
the law of nature, and whatever is in conformity with
nature is not evil.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Death, being a phenomenon in conformity with nature,
must be submitted to. “Do not abuse death,” advises
Marcus Aurelius, “but accept it with resignation, as being
in accordance with the will of nature. Do we not pass on
from infancy to youth, grow up, and become tall and attain
manhood? Do not our teeth come, our beards grow, and
our hair turn white? If we marry, do we not beget children?
Are not all such events in their due season, and the
work of nature? Death comes through the same agency.
It therefore behoves a wise man to approach death with
neither anger, repugnance, nor contempt, but to await it like
any other operation of nature.” <em>Resignation</em>, then, is what
this form of philosophy amounts to. Not only must death
be accepted as inevitable when it comes after a long life,
but even if it surprise us at an unexpected time. “He who
dies after reaching the uttermost limits of human life,”
says Marcus Aurelius, “has reached no further than he who
comes to a premature end. It is the same in the end,
whether there are a hundred years to look back upon, or
whether there are only three.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In his book on Marcus Aurelius, Renan<a id='r211'></a><a href='#f211' class='c014'><sup>[211]</sup></a> compares his
philosophy of resignation with the Nirvâna of the Buddhists.
“Like Jesus, Çakya-Mouni, Socrates, Francis of
Assisi, and three or four other wise men, Marcus Aurelius
was victor over death. He could laugh at it, because it
had no longer any meaning for him.” But, just as the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>theories of Buddha became transformed into a religion
which promised the immortality of the soul, and as Nirvâna
gave way to the Paradise of the Easterns with its
delights, so the sceptical resignation of ancient philosophy
was vanquished by Christianity with its promises of a future
life and immortality.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus, in the course of the centuries, philosophy has been
drowned in the floods of sentiment and of religious notions,
and it has been a labour of Sisyphus to restore reason to
humanity. There is the less need to follow the stages of
this resurrection, as, in the end, they come to little. For
long, philosophical systems set themselves the task of supporting
the dogmas of religion by arguments independent
of divine revelation. The gods were replaced by philosophy
or by matter, and an effort was made to solve the
eternal and disquieting problem of death by proving the
immortality of the soul.</p>

<p class='c007'>The philosophers of the early renaissance of human
thought accepted the chief religious dogmas as established
truth. Plotin regarded the immortality of the soul as a
self-evident truth that required no proof. He argued
against a resurrection of the body, but accepted the transmigration
of souls.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although Spinoza had given up the conception of the
immortality of the soul in the ordinary sense, he accepted
the Aristotelian idea that “the human spirit could not be
destroyed absolutely with the body, but left some eternal
remnant.” Death, in his view, was a kind of eternal life,
a merging with the absolute, a return to the immortal and
universal substance.</p>

<p class='c007'>Philosophers have exhausted themselves in the study of
the foundations of human knowledge with the sole object
of demonstrating the truth of religious dogmas. In spite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>of his scepticism, Kant tried to prove the genuineness of
human knowledge, and to found on that a conviction of
the future life and of the existence of God. Fichte set
himself the same task, but he was forced to recognise that
“immortality cannot be deduced from natural phenomena,”
and that it “is supernatural.” “Although we cannot
understand the possibility of eternal life, it still may
be possible, for it transcends human knowledge.” Hegel
reached a pantheistic conclusion and believed in the human
soul being re-absorbed by the absolute.</p>

<p class='c007'>These idealistic systems, when they reached their final
point, provoked a reaction consisting in the rejection of
all formulas based on speculation. They were succeeded
by a dogmatic materialism, which in its turn gave place
to a sceptical positivism, or rather to a form of agnosticism.
Granted the impossibility of belief in the immortality of the
soul or in eternal life in any shape, the philosophy regarding
death was reduced to the stoical idea that our end is
in harmony with the laws of nature, and that it must therefore
be accepted without protest. Resignation, therefore,
in the fullest sense of the word, became the watchword of
human wisdom.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was only to be expected that certain courageous and
independent thinkers should not agree with this conclusion,
and attempt to discover some other solution of the
great problem absorbing mankind. Thence arose pessimism,
the philosophic theory which became so prevalent during
the last century, and which claims so many adherents in
the present day. Pessimism, like belief in the immortality
of the soul and the advocacy of resignation to the evils which
beset humanity, is the product of the East, and India was
probably its nursery. A pessimistic view of life is a salient
feature of Brahminism, but Buddhism develops even more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>fully the doctrine that everything of this world is evil.
That “life is made up of suffering” is the inexhaustible theme
which, whether in the shape of philosophical argument, or
in the more attractive form of poetry, the Buddhist Scriptures
din ceaselessly in our ears.<a id='r212'></a><a href='#f212' class='c014'><sup>[212]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In Europe, the lyrical poets introduced the pessimistic
conception of the world, attracted by its emotional appeal.
At the beginning of the nineteenth century, Byron struck
this sad note, and expressed the view in the clearest fashion,
that if we weighed our hours of joy against our days of
pain, we should perceive clearly that whatever our life had
been it were better not have been. In the following
lines his conception of life is apparent:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Our life is a false nature,—’tis not in</div>
      <div class='line'>The harmony of things, this hard decree,</div>
      <div class='line'>This uneradicable taint of sin,</div>
      <div class='line'>This boundless Upas, this all-blasting tree,</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Whose root is earth, whose leaves and branches be</div>
      <div class='line'>The skies, which rain their plagues on men like dew—</div>
      <div class='line'>Disease, death, bondage—all the woes we see—</div>
      <div class='line'>And, worse, the woes we see not—which throbs through</div>
      <div class='line'>The immedicable soul, with heart-aches ever new.”</div>
      <div class='line in44'>“<span class='sc'>Euthanasia.</span>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>In chap. vi. I showed that Byron was haunted by a
fear of death which ultimately led him to a recognition of
the instinctive character of the feeling. He, however, like
the other pessimistic poets (Leopardi), did not regard the
world as being merely part of a universal system, and it was
left to philosophy to come to this conclusion.</p>

<p class='c007'>During the first half of the nineteenth century, Schopenhauer
endeavoured to give a presentation of a pessimistic
theory, borrowed from Hindoo religions and from the views
of contemporary poets, in the form of a rational philosophy.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>He developed a conception of life according to which “existence
is to be regarded as something one is better without,
as a kind of mistake which should be remedied when recognised.”<a id='r213'></a><a href='#f213' class='c014'><sup>[213]</sup></a>
According to Schopenhauer existence is wrong,
and results from the gratification of unrestrained desire.
“If an attempt be made to realise the amount of misery,
pain, and evil of all kinds, that the sun shines upon in its
daily course, it will be seen how much better it would be
were the earth to exhibit as few phenomena of life as the
moon, and if the surface of the earth were in a similarly
crystallised condition. Human life might equally be interpreted
as a useless disturbance of the exquisite tranquillity
of nothingness,” the meaning of the disturbance being
wrapped in impenetrable mystery.<a id='r214'></a><a href='#f214' class='c014'><sup>[214]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>This melancholy state of life was the result of the cosmic
process, which has created so much evil, and which finally
evolved the human species, capable of feeling and appreciating
to the full the pain of the world. The lower animals
he regards as happier than man, their senses being less fully
developed, and being unconscious of the worst aspects of
their existence. In man, pleasure is purely a negation,
whereas the sensation of pain is passive, contemplation,
a human monopoly, rendering suffering still more unbearable.
“Man’s capacity for pain increases far more with the
passage of time than does his capacity for enjoyment, and
is especially increased by his foreknowledge of death.
Animals only fear death from instinct, without having any
real knowledge of it, and without having the prospect of it
always before their eyes, as is the case with human beings.”<a id='r215'></a><a href='#f215' class='c014'><sup>[215]</sup></a>
Schopenhauer was convinced that happiness should not be
regarded as the aim of life. “The greatest mistake we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>can make,” he said in his principal work,<a id='r216'></a><a href='#f216' class='c014'><sup>[216]</sup></a> “is to imagine
that we are placed here to be happy.” “So long as we continue
in this erroneous view which optimistic doctrines
serve to foster, the world will continue to seem a mass of
contradictions to us.” “It would be nearer the truth to
regard pain as the aim of life rather than pleasure.” “The
destiny of all human existence seems to be suffering. Life
is wrapped about with evil, and cannot be protected from
it. Life, at its very beginning, is signalised by tears, its
course is fundamentally tragic, and still more tragic is its
end. It is impossible to ignore that all this is meant to be.”
“Death is the real goal of life. Its attainment brings a solution
of all that has gone before.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The prospect and expectation of death, being products of
reason, are experienced by men and not by animals. “Only
in the case of humanity is the will capable of renouncing
and withdrawing from life.”</p>

<p class='c007'>What is the answer to all these contradictions and the
explanation of a cosmic process which on the one hand
leads but to death, and on the other hand develops the
intelligence so as to enable it to fear and dread the inevitable
end? Is the solution to be found in belief in the immortality
of the soul, supported as it is not only by nearly every
form of religion, but by numerous systems of philosophy?
Schopenhauer devotes many pages to the discussion of this
question. He neither supports the doctrine of the resurrection
of the body, nor the immortality of the conscious
soul. “Just as the individual has no memory of prenatal
existence, so after death he will remember nothing of his
present life.”<a id='r217'></a><a href='#f217' class='c014'><sup>[217]</sup></a> “Those who regard birth as the actual
beginning of man’s life must necessarily face death as final,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>the two being parallel. No man can therefore regard himself
as immortal without forfeiting his belief in his own birth.
Birth and death have the same origin and the same significance.
They represent but one line, extending in opposite
directions. If birth implies an origin from nothingness,
then death must be complete annihilation.”<a id='r218'></a><a href='#f218' class='c014'><sup>[218]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>There is no such thing as individual immortality. But,
according to Schopenhauer, to desire such immortality
would merely be to advocate “the eternal perpetuation of
a great mistake. Each individual existence is a definite
mistake, a blunder, something that would better not have
been, and the object of existence should be to end it.”<a id='r219'></a><a href='#f219' class='c014'><sup>[219]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>But if man, as an individual, is mortal, “death only takes
away what was given by birth, that is to say, the principle
by which death itself became possible.”<a id='r220'></a><a href='#f220' class='c014'><sup>[220]</sup></a> “Consciousness
ceases at death, but the cause which produced that consciousness
persists; life comes to an end, but not the
principle which became manifest by life.”<a id='r221'></a><a href='#f221' class='c014'><sup>[221]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>What then is this immortal principle? It is the idea of
the species or genus. Men or dogs, as individuals, perish in
due course, but the human species or the canine species,
the man “idea” or the dog “idea,” endures. Here Schopenhauer
reverted to the conception of Spinoza, who, indeed,
denied the immortality of the soul, but none the less believed
in the immortality of the principle of life. This everlasting
principle, according to Schopenhauer, is the will
in its widest and most metaphysical sense, while, on the
other hand, the mortal soul is the reason, a product of the
functions of the brain.</p>

<p class='c007'>The eternal principle of life cannot be defined, because
“we cannot pass outside the limits of our consciousness.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>And thus the problem of what it is in itself cannot be
resolved.”<a id='r222'></a><a href='#f222' class='c014'><sup>[222]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Schopenhauer himself recognises that this solution of
the problem is not satisfactory from the point of view of
those who desire reassurance of their immortality. “But,”
he continues, “it is better than nothing, for those who
dread death from the point of view of absolute annihilation
should not despise the certainty of the persistence of the
most vital principle of life.”<a id='r223'></a><a href='#f223' class='c014'><sup>[223]</sup></a> He further remarks that
it must be remembered that nature is interested only in
the preservation of the species, being indifferent to the
individual. We ourselves being only a part of nature ought
to further its plans. “If we wish to attain to a wider
knowledge of nature, we must place ourselves more in sympathy
with it, and regard life and death indifferently.”<a id='r224'></a><a href='#f224' class='c014'><sup>[224]</sup></a>
Schopenhauer himself feels that his theories and arguments
are unsatisfactory. When he had reached the full development
of his doctrine, he admitted that it was negative in
character, and that it ended in negation. It spoke only
of what it had to deny and of what ought to be abandoned.
It was obliged to regard as nothingness all that could be
acquired in the future. As a consolation, he added that he
meant relative nothingness, and not absolute nothingness.</p>

<p class='c007'>As an ultimate aim, there remained nothing but abrogation
of the will to live, and thus misery and wretchedness,
which are the inseparable accompaniments of human life,
led to resignation.</p>

<p class='c007'>As our life is no more than a succession of misfortunes,
and as, according to Schopenhauer, death is the plain conclusion
of philosophy, the end of the individual life must be
pleasant. As a general rule, he said, the death of a well-regulated
life is calm and peaceful. But the privilege of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>dying willingly, with joy and delight, is reserved for him
who has learned resignation, and has abolished and abandoned
his will to live. For such an one would be willing
to die in reality, not merely in appearance, and would neither
desire nor claim a personal immortality. He would give
up readily the existence that we know. Whatever may
replace that existence is nothing from the point of view of
individuality. The Buddhistic faith called the position
attained by him who had given up the will to live, “Nirvâna,
or nothingness.”<a id='r225'></a><a href='#f225' class='c014'><sup>[225]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The natural deduction from this pessimistic doctrine of
Schopenhauer would be to abolish the will to live by
abolishing our individual life by suicide. But such is not
the advice of the philosopher. He is far, however, from
agreeing with those who regard suicide as criminal.<a id='r226'></a><a href='#f226' class='c014'><sup>[226]</sup></a> He
merely does not admit that it solves the question. “He
who commits suicide destroys the individual only, and not
the species.” “Suicide is the voluntary destruction of a
solitary phenomenon, without in the smallest degree affecting
the system as a whole.”<a id='r227'></a><a href='#f227' class='c014'><sup>[227]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The will to live manifesting itself, according to Schopenhauer,
by the creation of new individuals, the philosopher
would naturally, in accordance with his views of life, abstain
from bringing others into the world. Schopenhauer lived
and died a bachelor, and, so far as I am aware, had no children.
On the other hand, convinced that the solution of life’s
problem did not lie in suicide, he clung tenaciously to life.
Having relinquished a belief in the immortality of the soul,
he fell back upon a belief in the persistence of some ultimate
principle, apart from conscious life, and held that in resignation
and desire for annihilation (Nirvâna, according to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>his interpretation of the Buddhist doctrines) lay the true
consolation for all the evils of human existence.</p>

<p class='c007'>For a long time Schopenhauer’s views found no echo in
the opinions of other thinkers. Later, however, they became
more and more widely diffused, and philosophic pessimism
became quite fashionable. Those who did not adopt the
metaphysical principles of Schopenhauer’s philosophy
agreed with his views on life and on the impossibility of
happiness.</p>

<p class='c007'>Exactly half a century after the publication of Schopenhauer’s
principal work,<a id='r228'></a><a href='#f228' class='c014'><sup>[228]</sup></a> another German philosopher,
E. Hartmann,<a id='r229'></a><a href='#f229' class='c014'><sup>[229]</sup></a> went a step further in the same direction.
Without agreeing wholly with his metaphysics, he
shared Schopenhauer’s views on the impossibility of regarding
happiness as the true aim of existence. In order to
demonstrate this theory, he examined the three phases of
illusion through which mankind passes. He held that, in
the first phase, people imagined happiness to be attainable
during the present life. However, all that have been regarded
as the sources of joy—youth, health, desire, conjugal love,
family love, glory, etc.—end in disillusion. Love itself is
especially submitted to Hartmann’s implacable criticism.
According to him, there can be no question but that “love
causes far more suffering than pleasure to those concerned.”<a id='r230'></a><a href='#f230' class='c014'><sup>[230]</sup></a>
“It cannot be doubted,” he says, “that reason would prompt
a total abstention from love,” and, as a means to this end,
he recommends “the extinction of sexual desire by castration,
if that could be relied upon to destroy desire.”<a id='r231'></a><a href='#f231' class='c014'><sup>[231]</sup></a> That,
according to Hartmann, “is the only possible means of
securing the happiness of the individual.” It is at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>sacrifice of his personal happiness that man permits himself
to love, and so abets the evolution of the cosmic process.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When they have become convinced of the impossibility
of obtaining happiness in this world, people persuade themselves
that it may be obtained after death in a transcendental
life in another world. This, however, is only a second
phase of illusion, and is based upon faith in life after death
and eternity. It is certain, however, that the individuality
of the organic body as well as that of the mind is only a
delusion which ceases with death.”<a id='r232'></a><a href='#f232' class='c014'><sup>[232]</sup></a> Hartmann says in
conclusion that “it is therefore plain that the hope of the
immortality of the individual soul is also a mere illusion.
And thus the chief support of the Christian promises is
cut away; for men are devoted to their dear selves, and take
little interest in a future happiness in which they themselves
are to have no share.”<a id='r233'></a><a href='#f233' class='c014'><sup>[233]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Being disillusioned regarding the possibility of obtaining
happiness in this world, or in a future state, humanity falls
back upon a third illusion. Firmly convinced that the aim
of life is true happiness, man concluded that it was only
attainable in some future state of the cosmic process. This
hypothesis is based upon belief in a system of progressive
development. “This,” declares Hartmann, “is yet another
mistake. Humanity may progress as much as it likes,”
he says, “but it will never succeed in suppressing or even
diminishing the greatest evils which beset it: disease, old
age, dependence on the wishes or the power of others,
misery and discontent. Notwithstanding the new remedies
which are discovered, the number of diseases, especially
those of a chronic nature which are so trying, continues to
increase at a rate that medicine cannot keep pace with.
Joyous youth will always constitute a small portion of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>humanity, while the greater part will consist of melancholy
old age.”<a id='r234'></a><a href='#f234' class='c014'><sup>[234]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Against this idea that the happiness of the race will be the
eventual result of progress, Hartmann employs the following
arguments: “The happiest people are those who are
the rudest and most primitive, and, among civilised races,
the uneducated classes. It is well known that the progress
of education increases discontent. The progress of
science contributes little or nothing to the absolute happiness
of the world. Practically speaking, this progress is of
advantage to politics, social life, morality, and the arts;
but factories, steam-boats, railways, and telegraphs, have
so far done no positive good to humanity.”<a id='r235'></a><a href='#f235' class='c014'><sup>[235]</sup></a> Hartmann
frequently recurs to the conclusion that the primitive are
happier than the civilised, and that “the lower classes,
inferior and rude, are happier than the rich who are well
educated and great; that idiots are happier than the intelligent,
and that, as a general rule, the less sensitive a man’s
nervous system may be, the happier he is, as his capacity
for feeling pain is not so much in excess of his capacity for
enjoyment, and his illusion is therefore greater. With the
progressive development of humanity, however, not only
is there an increase in the extent of human needs, but in the
sensitiveness of the nervous system, and in the cultivation
of the mind. In consequence, the balance of pain over
pleasure increases, and the illusion is destroyed, that is to
say, knowledge comes of the misery of life, of the vanity of
most of the pleasures. Misery itself increases as much as
knowledge of misery, as experience has shown; and the
apparent increase of happiness in the world, due to the
progress of universe, is merely superficial.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having reached this extremely pessimistic conclusion, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>it is impossible for humanity to attain happiness, Hartmann
proceeds to inquire into the real destiny of man. He would
be no true philosopher if he did not hold that the world was
created according to a general plan, and that it follows a
regular course tending towards a definite end. “We have
seen,” he says, “how that in the present world all has been
arranged in the wisest, and for the most part the best way,
and that it should therefore be regarded as the best possible
of worlds. Notwithstanding this, however, it is supremely
miserable, and worse than if it did not exist at all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Being convinced of the illusory nature of its hopes,
humanity “must definitely renounce all pretensions to
positive happiness, and aspire only to a freedom from pain,
to annihilation or Nirvâna. This, however, must not be
merely the attitude of solitary individuals, but humanity
at large must cry out for annihilation. This is the only
possible outcome of the third and last phase of illusion.”</p>

<p class='c007'>By what means is this end to be attained? Hartmann
is no advocate of suicide as the best remedy of the evils
of human existence. Upon this point he agrees with Schopenhauer,
and thinks that such a course would have no
effect upon the general progress of the cosmic process. A
renunciation of pleasure—asceticism—would present no
better solution of the problem. Even abstinence from reproduction
would not serve the purpose. “What good would
it do,” says Hartmann, “if humanity were to cease to be
by means of sexual abstinence? This unfortunate universe
would continue to exist, and the Unconscious would
immediately take advantage of the opportunity to create
a new man or some other similar type.”<a id='r236'></a><a href='#f236' class='c014'><sup>[236]</sup></a> Thus it is not
the disappearance of mankind that should constitute our
aim, but “the complete abandonment of the individual to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>the cosmic process, in order that the latter may accomplish
its end and bring about the universal deliverance of the
world.”<a id='r237'></a><a href='#f237' class='c014'><sup>[237]</sup></a> This being so, the instinctive love of life reasserts
itself, and it becomes necessary to admit, at least as provisional
truth, “the validity of the will to live; for it is
only by complete resignation to life and its troubles, and not
by cowardly renunciation and abandonment, that one may
contribute one’s share in the development of the cosmic
process.”<a id='r238'></a><a href='#f238' class='c014'><sup>[238]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Hartmann’s proposed solution of the problem of human
existence belongs undoubtedly to the category of systems
advocating resignation. He is unable to tell us what is the
cosmic process to which he bids man lend all his forces.
He advises humanity to continue to live and to multiply
in the full certainty that happiness cannot be attained.
Hartmann obviously demands a true renunciation and an
absolute submission. His solution has the appearance of
being more exact, and of furnishing a guide to human conduct
more clear than that vague aspiration to Nirvâna proposed
by Schopenhauer. But on closer investigation it
becomes at once plain that the greater precision is illusory.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is easy to see, under such circumstances, that a school
of criticism or negation of the pessimistic doctrines should
have gained many adherents. Very few, on the other
hand, have embraced pessimistic doctrines because of any
power being inherent in them to resolve the difficulties of
life. A German pessimistic philosopher, Mailaender,<a id='r239'></a><a href='#f239' class='c014'><sup>[239]</sup></a> shared
fully Schopenhauer’s opinions as to the misery of human
life, but opposed the latter’s doctrine of resignation and
Nirvâna as the solution of the general problem of life.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>Mailaender accepted the three stages of human illusion as
expounded by Hartmann, but attacked vigorously the view
of facilitating the cosmic process by acquiescence in the
will to live. “Indeed,” he cried, “your advice is that we
should sacrifice ourselves to the cosmos, we are to choose
a career, to learn a trade, acquire money, property, fame,
power, and so forth; we are to marry and to beget offspring;
by such advice you are merely undoing with your own
hands the sole merit of your work, the analysis of illusion.
You suddenly advise the very man who has got behind all
these illusions to succumb to them again, as if an illusion,
although it has been recognised, could still deceive and exercise
its power.”<a id='r240'></a><a href='#f240' class='c014'><sup>[240]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Mailaender takes an entirely different view of the problem.
Like his predecessors, he is convinced of the futility of happiness,
but he has achieved an original view of the cosmic
process. He holds that an unaccountable and divine Being
existed before the creation of the world. Before disappearing
“this divinity gave birth to the universe.” By this
means, complete annihilation was made possible. “The
world,” says Mailaender, “is but the means for bringing
about a condition of non-existence, and is the only possible
means by which that end could be attained. God knew
that only by creating a real world could we pass from
existence into non-existence.” Maileander regards as certain
“that the universe tends towards universal non-existence.”<a id='r241'></a><a href='#f241' class='c014'><sup>[241]</sup></a>
This tendency is characterised by the weakening
of the total amount of energy, so that “every individual at
the close of the weakening process to which his energy is
submitted, is led in the course of his development to the
point at which his desire for annihilation may be fulfilled.”<a id='r242'></a><a href='#f242' class='c014'><sup>[242]</sup></a>
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>Life on our planet, he says, ought to be regarded as a halting-place
on the road to death. In order to appreciate fully the
happiness brought by death, it is necessary first to taste of
life, and that is why the instinct of self-preservation is so
well developed in animals. Man passes first through a
phase of development in which he is like any other animal.
“As with them, the will to live is stronger than the will to
die. Life is clung to with extreme pertinacity, and death
is proportionately execrated.” “At first, not only the fear
of death increases, but equally the love of life.” Terror of
death becomes acuter. Animals, knowing nothing of death,
only fear it instinctively through their perception of approaching
danger. Man, on the contrary, knows of the existence of
death and what it means. He looks back on his past life
and wonders what the future may hold in store, and realises,
infinitely more than animals realise it, the dangers that
threaten him. During this phase, man does all in his power
to keep death at bay, and to make his life as happy as
possible. This, however, is not the last stage of his development.
The thinking man soon comes to the conclusion that
a craving for life is not the true aim of the universe; it is
only the means for attaining to a knowledge of the definite
aim of existence, which is the cessation of life. Philosophy
soon shows that perfect happiness is not possible, and that
only death is really desirable. In summing up the cosmic
process, the conclusion arrived at is “that throughout the
universe the desire of death exists in a form more or less
masked, but that in the organic world this assumes the form
of a will to live.”<a id='r243'></a><a href='#f243' class='c014'><sup>[243]</sup></a> In the end, however, the desire of
death becomes more and more plain, until the philosopher
can see “in the whole universe nothing but a longing for
absolute extinction, and fancies that he can hear the cry
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>rolling from star to star, ‘Deliverance, deliverance, death
to our life!’ and the echoing cry of consolation, ‘Extinction
and deliverance await you all!’”<a id='r244'></a><a href='#f244' class='c014'><sup>[244]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>In order to explain in a clearer way the progress of this
evolution, Mailaender describes the state of mind of a man
who develops the will to die, and commits suicide. “At first
he glances anxiously and from afar at death, and shrinks from
it with horror. Later, he draws nearer and walks round
it in wide circles. Day by day, however, these circles become
smaller, until finally he embraces Death with weary arms
and looks it straight in the face. Then Peace comes; gentle
Peace!”<a id='r245'></a><a href='#f245' class='c014'><sup>[245]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It is absurd to expect anything to follow death but absolute
annihilation, and the ordinary man faces this prospect
with terror. “But it is essential,” says Mailaender, “that
man should dominate the universe by knowledge, and wise
men look forward to total annihilation with joy.”<a id='r246'></a><a href='#f246' class='c014'><sup>[246]</sup></a> “In
relinquishing Schopenhauer’s will to live,” concluded Mailaender,
“I have finally arrived at the will to die. I have
raised myself upon the shoulders of Schopenhauer, until I
have attained a point of view such as others have never
accomplished. At present I am alone, but behind me all
humanity is pressing on to freedom; and before me is the
clear translucent vista of the future.”<a id='r247'></a><a href='#f247' class='c014'><sup>[247]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>I have quoted these views, not because of the solidity
of Mailaender’s arguments, but merely because this
pessimistic philosopher proved himself to be more consistent
than his predecessors. While Schopenhauer and
Hartmann, both so firmly convinced of the non-existence
of happiness and the vast preponderance of suffering in
all imaginable conditions of life, lived out their lives,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>Mailaender, true to his principles, committed suicide when
barely thirty-five years of age.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is probably not a solitary instance. Under the
influence of pessimism, a certain number of young persons,
especially those whose mental equilibrium is not very firmly
established, follow in the tragic footsteps of Mailaender.
Some commit suicide, while others abstain from taking part
in the perpetuation of the race. Others, but these are not
many, curtail their existence by dissipation, thinking life
not worth the care of it.</p>

<p class='c007'>A modern writer of great talent, Maeterlinck, echoes
the pessimism of the present generation. “It is plain,”
he says,<a id='r248'></a><a href='#f248' class='c014'><sup>[248]</sup></a> “that from one point of view humanity will
always seem wretched, and as though being dragged towards
a fatal precipice, since it will ever be doomed to disease,
to the inconstancy of matter, to old age and to death.”
“Yes, human life as a whole is sad, and it is easier, I
may almost say pleasanter, to discuss and expose its dark
side, than to enumerate its consolations and make the best
of them. The miseries of life are many, obvious, and
never failing; whereas the consolations, or rather the
reasons which cause us to fulfil with alacrity the duty of
living, are rare, hard to seek, and precarious.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Although pessimism has been greatly developed and widely
spread during the nineteenth century, dissentient voices in
opposition to this negative attitude towards the things of
this world have not been wanting. Take the views of the
German poet, Robert Hammerling,<a id='r249'></a><a href='#f249' class='c014'><sup>[249]</sup></a> who reproaches the
pessimistic philosophers with ignoring the attitude of mind
of the majority of mankind who ask but one thing,—life—life
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>at any price and under any conditions. Against this
sentiment all dogmatic arguments are useless, for, according
to Hammerling, the question of pleasure and pain is a matter
of feeling and not of reason. Now, with regard to the general
feeling of humanity, there can be no doubt—it is frankly
optimistic.</p>

<p class='c007'>Max Nordau, the well-known writer, supports a similar
theory. According to him, all living nature betrays its
optimistic foundation. “The truth is,” he says, “that optimism,
limitless and irradicable optimism, constitutes the
fundamental attitude of man, and is the instinctive feeling
which governs him under all circumstances. All other forms
of life confirm this truth....” “All nature,” according
to Max Nordau, “by the bells of flowers and the throats of
her birds, rings and proclaims the truth of optimism.” “No
animals feel the pain of the world; and our own ancestor,
the contemporary of the cave bear, was certainly free from
all anxiety relating to the destiny of the human race.”</p>

<p class='c007'>These arguments do not take into account that, to be
true, pessimism need not necessarily be felt and agreed with
by all living creatures. Birds and other animals, happy in
their lives, that is to say optimists, know nothing of the
inevitability of death. Our cave ancestors knew nothing
of it either. If the greater portion of modern humanity is
optimistic, that might be accounted for by its being still
under the influence of one of the three phases of illusion
alluded to by Hartmann. It is only when the highest stage
of development is reached that man, being convinced of the
futility of his hopes, arrives at a pessimistic conception of
the universe.</p>

<p class='c007'>Max Nordau disclaims discipleship of Doctor Pangloss,
who held that the world is the best of all possible worlds.
But his arguments reveal a pronounced optimism. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>regards pain as an indispensable factor of the maintenance
of life. “Without pain,” he says, “our lives would not
endure an hour, for we should be unable to recognise dangerous
symptoms and guard against them.” Insensibility
to pain is often so grave a symptom that sick people rejoice
when they are again able to feel the prick of a needle.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is true enough, but none the less the feeling of pain
is very erratic in both animals and human beings. Quite
insignificant causes and unimportant illnesses, such as certain
forms of neuralgia, give rise to unbearable agony. A physiological
phenomenon such as childbirth is often attended
by extremely violent pain which is absolutely useless as
a danger-signal. On the other hand, some of the most
dangerous diseases, such as cancer or kidney disease, may
exist for a long time without causing any sensation of pain,
with the result that the sufferer knows nothing of the presence
of the disease until it is too late. Were pain to play the
part assigned to it by Nordau, it would appear in all cases
of danger, and yet would never become almost unbearably
acute.</p>

<p class='c007'>But when men have passed through the three stages of
illusion it is not physical pain which presses most heavily
on them. Max Nordau himself admits that it is “appalling
to think of the cessation of our consciousness, and the annihilation
of our ego.” None the less, he believes “that we
are so happily constituted as to be able to accept the really
inevitable with a light heart, and that there is no ill feeling
about the matter.” This admission is not in accordance
with the well-established facts discussed in chap. vi.
With very rare exceptions man does not willingly accept
the prospect of death, especially if he be still under the
influence of illusion in any of its three stages. As a rule
those who desire to live feel not only a repugnance to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>contemplation of death, but death seems to them something
abnormal and irrational. It is no answer to assert that all
who feel this are psychopaths, or that it is absurd to think
that the happiness of mankind counts for something in the
cosmic process. On the contrary, it is quite natural that
man should seek after happiness, and that he should try to
analyse the phenomena taking place within him and around
him from the point of view of that ideal. For this reason
it is quite unjust to say that pessimism cannot be treated
seriously. It is pessimism which has been the first to draw
up a true indictment of human nature, and if pain is to be
regarded as useful in its quality of danger-signal we should
equally recognise that the pessimistic view of the universe
is a step onwards in the evolution of humanity. Without
pessimism we might easily sink into a kind of contented
fatalism, and end in quietism, in the manner of many religions.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is only natural, however, that the thinking world should
not accept pessimism as the last word of human wisdom,
and that more or less noted philosophers should devote
themselves to finding a possible solution of the problem of
life and death. These systems of philosophy, one and all,
have abandoned readily all belief in future life and personal
immortality. But they have adopted pantheistic conceptions,
and have accepted the existence of some general principle
into which the individual consciousness will eventually
be absorbed. There is division of opinion as to the properties
of this principle. For some it is the Idea, for others
Will, for others Force, or Eternal Energy.<a id='r250'></a><a href='#f250' class='c014'><sup>[250]</sup></a> The nomenclature
is the less important as the views as to the nature
of the general principle are absolutely vague. Accordingly
this part of the philosophic doctrines appears in a lyrical
form and has passed over into the domain of poetry.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>German poets have helped to spread pantheistic conceptions
very widely. I need hardly mention Goethe, whose
ideas were purely those of Spinoza, but Schiller’s well-known
lines are precise:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span lang="de">Vor dem Tode erschrickst Du? Du <a id='t195a'></a>wünschest, unsterblich zu leben?</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="de">Leb’ im Ganzen! Wenn du lange dahin bist, es bleibt!</span>”</div>
    </div>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Do you shrink from approaching Death? and crave immortality?</div>
      <div class='line'>Live on in the All! Long after you vanish the All will remain!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>Rückert, in lines almost equally well known, expresses
the same idea:—</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c024'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span lang="de">Vernichtung weht dich an, so lang Du <a id='t195b'></a>Einzles bist.</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="de">O, fühl’ im Ganzen dich, das unvernichtbar ist.</span>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c025'>“Annihilation fills you with terror, because you are self-centred. You
must feel your unity with the All, which is indestructible.”</p>

<p class='c006'>A volume might be filled with the attempts of thinkers of
different countries to present these poetical ideas in a form
less vague and more philosophical. I shall select only a
few of the more modern instances.</p>

<p class='c007'>Renan’s<a id='r251'></a><a href='#f251' class='c014'><sup>[251]</sup></a> ideas may be taken as typical of the compromise
between poetry and philosophy. Speaking of immortality,
he said “that we shall each live again by the traces
we leave on the bosom of the Infinite.”<a id='r252'></a><a href='#f252' class='c014'><sup>[252]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The views elaborated by Guyau<a id='r253'></a><a href='#f253' class='c014'><sup>[253]</sup></a> are equally poetic.
Like so many others he is unable to accept without protest
the prospect of the inevitability of death. Brought face to
face with this end, he declares that he feels “not sorrow but
indignation, as against an injustice of nature.” “It is with
justice,” he cries, “that we look on nature as a murderess
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>if she kills what is morally best in ourselves and in
others.”<a id='r254'></a><a href='#f254' class='c014'><sup>[254]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It is chiefly in the name of love that Guyau protests
against death: “The death of others, the annihilation of
those we love, is insupportable to men, who are essentially
thinking and loving creatures.”<a id='r255'></a><a href='#f255' class='c014'><sup>[255]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>This problem, so vast and so difficult to solve, is presented
by him as follows: “As regards the question of individual
immortality, human thought is dragged in opposite directions
by two great forces—science, in the name of evolution,
prepared to sacrifice the individual completely; love, in
the name of an evolution, morally and socially higher, which
would preserve the individual at all hazards. There is no
more disturbing dilemma proposed to the philosopher.”<a id='r256'></a><a href='#f256' class='c014'><sup>[256]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Guyau hopes that in the course of evolution there will
come about a merging of individual consciousness in the
consciousness of the whole. “One may ask,” he says, “if
it may not be that these conscious entities mingling and
interpenetrating, may come to live on from one to the other,
and so to acquire a new duration?” On such a hypothesis
he can foresee “an epoch not, indeed, certain to come, but
far from inconceivable, in which individual consciousnesses
will have achieved a corporate integrity and a complex
intercommunion, without themselves being lost by the
union.”<a id='r257'></a><a href='#f257' class='c014'><sup>[257]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>On this hypothesis, “the problem is to be at the same
time loving enough and loved enough to live and endure in
another.<a id='r258'></a><a href='#f258' class='c014'><sup>[258]</sup></a>... Those who vanish and those who remain
must love one another so greatly that the shadows cast by
them on the universal consciousness are identical.” “We
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>should then feel ourselves passing and ascending from this
life to an immortality of love,” and “the point of contact
between life and immortality would be discovered.”<a id='r259'></a><a href='#f259' class='c014'><sup>[259]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>A solution recently offered by Finot<a id='r260'></a><a href='#f260' class='c014'><sup>[260]</sup></a> is much less poetical.
According to him, it is only “when death is conceived of as
annihilation that it is repugnant. On the other hand, if
we regard it merely as a change of life, we shall cease to
fear it, and even come to love it.”<a id='r261'></a><a href='#f261' class='c014'><sup>[261]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>But what is this “change of life” that is to prove so
consoling? It is the “immortality of the body,” that is
to say, the life of the creatures developed at the expense of
the human body. “Flies begin the work of the labourers
on the dead,” giving birth to worm-like larvæ that writhe
in the decomposing flesh. The same vermin that horrified
Tolstoi when he thought of his own death (see chap. vi.
p. <a href='#Page_123'>123</a>) became Finot’s symbol of consolation. He describes
the whole succession of the fauna of corpses, and concludes
by saying, “and so goes on the routine of life, from birth to
the tomb, of noisy, clamorous life, ceaselessly renewed.
Ever loving, giving birth, living and dying. The peace of
the tomb is as filled with life as the dust into which we
think our bodies will fall.”<a id='r262'></a><a href='#f262' class='c014'><sup>[262]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>I have given the above quotation as an instance showing
to what lengths men have gone in their search for a solution
of the problem of death and in their desire for a gleam of
hope that the end may not be final. I need not say that
this idea of the fauna of the corpse has no place in the
philosophy of death. Thinkers, no doubt, would prefer
the most vague ambiguities to certainties of such a nature.
Most contemporary philosophers regard the problem in a
very different fashion.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>In my opinion, Meyer-Benfey, a scholar at Göttingen, has
summed up the present condition of the problem very clearly
and exactly, in essays on Modern Religion.<a id='r263'></a><a href='#f263' class='c014'><sup>[263]</sup></a> He realises
that it is impossible to accept the immortality of the soul.
Personality must utterly and inevitably perish. But, just
as no single atom of our bodies can be annihilated, so “no
parts of our souls can be lost.” Our actions during life leave
traces so much the deeper as the life has been fuller. It is
this reuniting “of the actions of individuals with the life of
the whole of humanity, that constitutes the true immortality
or Nirvâna.” He says, too, “In accustoming our
minds to this thought, and in educating ourselves with a
view to the accomplishment of this end, lies the only possible
means of overcoming the fear of death and the terror of
annihilation.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Meyer-Benfey is of the pessimistic opinion that happiness
cannot possibly be regarded as the supreme end of humanity,
for he thinks, if that were so, the whole course of evolution
would have been a mistake. It would have been much
better had evolution been arrested before the creation of the
human race, since animals, being unaware of the inevitability
of death, are undoubtedly happier than man. As, however,
we have passed through the animal stage and reached the
human stage, and achieved some measure of civilisation,
and this not by our own desire, or as the result of mere
chance, but guided by the inner workings of our nature, it
is plain that the ultimate goal towards which we are advancing,
must be some other than mere happiness. There can
be no question but that the goal is the triumph of pure
and perfect culture.</p>

<p class='c007'>This idea, that the goal of humanity is progress in all its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>manifestations, is no recent theory, and many definitions of
this progress have been advanced, but so far none have been
generally accepted as satisfactory. The term “culture,”
though vague, will have to continue in use until some
better word conveying a more precise meaning is found to
replace it.</p>

<p class='c007'>On reviewing all the systems of philosophy which have
attempted so strenuously to solve the problem of individual
death, it becomes plain that all, or nearly all, of them deny
the existence of a future life and the immortality of the
soul. The greater part of them, however, admit some
general principle incomprehensible but eternal, which will
eventually incorporate within itself all individual souls.
Feeling that these vague ideas are incapable of conveying
consolation to poor humanity in its fear of annihilation
through death, philosophers have persistently taught the
advantages of resignation. Even Guyau, realising that his
philosophy regarding the immortality of love fails to reassure
those who look to philosophy for some word of consolation,
ends by admitting that “as there is no help to be
expected from the inexorable, nor mercy from that which
is in conformity with the universe and even with our own
judgment, resignation is best.”<a id='r264'></a><a href='#f264' class='c014'><sup>[264]</sup></a> As it is the general opinion
that to be philosophical is to take things as they are, without
undue protest, the watchword of all systems of philosophy
is to bow to the inevitable, that is to say, to be resigned to
the prospect of annihilation.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER IX<br> <span class='c012'>WHAT SCIENCE CAN DO AGAINST DISEASE</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c008'>Formation of the experimental method—The intervention
of religion in disease—Disease as a basis of pessimistic
systems of philosophy—Advance of medical science in the
war against disease—The revolution in medicine and surgery
due to the discoveries of Pasteur—The beneficial results of

Rousseau, Tolstoi, and Brunetière—Proclamation of the
fallibility of science—Return to religion and mysticism</p>

<p class='c006'>Science, the youngest daughter of knowledge, has begun
to investigate the great problems affecting humanity.
The chief religions and many systems of philosophy had
been long established before the spirit of scepticism dared
to inquire whether or no these products of the human mind
were really in harmony with fact. Scepticism gained
ground little by little, and open war was declared between
religious dogma and authority on the one side, and scientific
reason on the other.</p>

<p class='c007'>The great religions and the philosophy of Aristotle had
ruled a majority of mankind for some twenty centuries
before doubt was cast on the real value of these doctrines.</p>

<p class='c007'>Francis Bacon, Lord Verulam, asked why it was that
all the systems of his time were so vague and so powerless
to explain the phenomena of the world. The cause could
not lie in nature herself, for without doubt she followed laws
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>that were immutable and that could be subjected to exact
observation; nor could it lie in any want of intelligence
in those men who devoted themselves to solve the problems.
The true cause of the failure lay in the falsity or insufficiency
of the methods employed. Bacon, trying to provide a
remedy for this condition of affairs, advised that makers
of generalisations should proceed very slowly, passing only
by the smallest stages from particular facts to conclusions
only more general in the slightest degree, and so on, until
the ultimate formula might be reached. By such a path
it was possible to attain principles neither vague nor ambiguous,
but clear and exact and that would not be denied
by nature herself.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first steps taken by science according to this method,
which indeed had been suggested long ago, but which was
first clearly laid down by Bacon, were slow and halting.
Religious and philosophical doctrines still weighed heavily
on inquiring minds, so that the new method was not followed
with any great courage. None the less progress was
achieved, until at length the great problems of humanity
opened out. More than two thousand years before the
birth of exact science, Buddha had given voice to the
chief grievances of the human race. “Behold, O monks,
the holy truth as to suffering,” he had proclaimed in the
Sermon at Benares, “birth is suffering, old age is suffering,
disease is suffering, and death is suffering.” Science,
in its slow progress, passing from particular to general,
reached first one of these four sorrows, the suffering due to
disease.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the Buddhist legend that I quoted in chap. vi.,
the sight of a sick man “whose senses were weakened,
who drew his breath with difficulty, whose limbs were
shrivelled, whose bowels were wrung with pain, and his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>body pitifully soiled with excrement,” suggested to Buddha
the reflection that “health is no more than the idle vision
of a dream while fear and disease are horrible realities.
What wise man, having seen the thing that life is, can still
think of joy or of pleasure? Woe upon health which is
assailed by so many maladies.” When Buddha, who was
a young prince, asked of his father the gift “that he might
always remain full of health, and that he should be smitten
by no disease,” his father, who was the king, replied: “You
ask me what is impossible; in that my son, I can do
nothing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>From that day, every religion has busied itself with the
cure and prevention of disease. They believed that the
causes of these were the influence of evil spirits or the
visitations of God; and as remedies they prescribed sacrifice
and prayer and anything that might avert the anger
of God. Even at the present day, similar medicine is used
by primitive races. In Sumatra for instance, when it is
impossible to arrest the flow of blood from a wound, the
disaster is ascribed to an evil spirit (Polasièq) who is sucking
the wound and making it incurable. In Nias, when
bleeding from the nose occurs in children, it is supposed
to be due to the father having killed a cock during the pregnancy
of the mother. The indispensable remedy is to make
sacrifice to the outraged deity.</p>

<p class='c007'>No doubt there co-exist with such practices of primitive
races, certain useful rules, based on correct observation
or on experience. It is a common practice to try all manner
of remedies on the sick; although most do harm, now and
again something useful may be discovered. Such vulgar
medicine has undoubted merit, but it cannot be compared
with the results of scientific medicine, which are drawn
from rigorous experiment.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>Medical science has been slow in developing, but it has
now reached a condition of which humanity may be proud.
It is outside my purpose to give a long exposition of this
subject; but it is necessary to my argument to set out a
few facts from which the reader may judge of the present
condition of medical science.</p>

<p class='c007'>Without doubt the fear of disease has played a large part
in the pessimistic conceptions of the universe. Not only
the words of Buddha that I have quoted, but many of
the systems of pessimistic philosophy attest this. I have
already stated in chap. vi. that Schopenhauer in 1831 was
driven from Berlin to Frankfurt by fear of cholera.</p>

<p class='c007'>In his statement of the case against this universe, and
as a chief argument for his proposition that “this is the
worst of possible worlds” Schopenhauer adduced the
spreading of epidemics. “An alteration of the atmosphere
so slight that it cannot be detected by chemistry brings
about cholera, or yellow fever, or the black death, diseases
which number their victims by millions; an alteration
slightly greater might destroy all life.”<a id='r265'></a><a href='#f265' class='c014'><sup>[265]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Hartmann, who has been one of the chief advocates of
Schopenhauer’s pessimism, also had gloomy views on
diseases and medicine. He was convinced that howsoever
great the progress of humanity might come to be, there
never would be an end or even a diminution of diseases.
“It is no matter,” he said, “how many remedies may be
discovered for diseases; new diseases, and particularly
chronic affections which, although not serious are extremely
painful, will continue to appear more rapidly than the
discoveries of medicine.”<a id='r266'></a><a href='#f266' class='c014'><sup>[266]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Humanity will be fortunate if the pessimistic philosophers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>prove as wrong about their other grievances as they have
proved about disease and medicine. To understand the
vast progress made by medicine, it is necessary only to
compare the complaint of Schopenhauer with the actual
state of affairs. When he spoke of epidemics being due
to slight changes of the atmosphere, Schopenhauer obviously
was repeating the medical opinion current in his times.
Experimental science has proved that he was quite wrong.
It has been shown conclusively that two of the great affections
of which he spoke, cholera and plague, are due not
to chemical changes in the air, but to definite microbes,
the natural history of which is known as well as that of
any other plant. Cholera is produced by the vibrio, discovered
by Koch, a minute organism that lives in water
and that enters the human alimentary canal with food or
drink. We do not yet know a definite cure for cholera,
but we do know how to prevent infection. The most
simple mode of guarding against infection is to swallow
only material that has been boiled, and to prevent contamination
of water or of vessels with fæcal matter containing
the Koch’s vibrio. Moreover, in individual cases
use may be made of anti-cholera serums. In 1831, if these
discoveries had been made, philosophy would have taken
a different course. Instead of trembling at the epidemic,
and flying to Frankfurt, Schopenhauer would have remained
quietly at Berlin, and Hegel would not have ceased to
develop his idealism in the university of that town.</p>

<p class='c007'>Schopenhauer enforced his argument by reference to
the black death “capable of destroying millions of victims.”
It is certain that the black death was no other than human
plague, which made enormous ravages, in the fourteenth
century, for instance, destroying nearly a third of the population
of Europe. In those days, no one doubted but that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>it was a visitation of the Divine wrath, and people gathered
in churches to make common supplication. Sacrifices
were offered and flagellations took place in the hope of
averting the terrible malady. Travellers who have been
in the capital of Austria must have seen in one of the chief
streets (Graben) a large and unlovely monument, erected
in the seventeenth century to commemorate the interposition
of Providence in staying one of the great epidemics
of plague. Now that science has made known the true
cause of plague, our ideas as to the causes of the appearance
and disappearance of epidemics are very different. Plague
is not the manifestation of the anger of God, but is a scourge
due to invasion by a minute organism, discovered simultaneously
by Kitasato and Yersin in 1894. The natural
history of the microbe has been studied, and we know that
it may live not only in human bodies but in the bodies of
small rodents, such as rats and mice, which live in association
with man. These animals are the source of human
infection, and it is necessary to destroy them as completely
as possible. There is no doubt but that the arrest of the
plague in the seventeenth century was due to the fact that
rats and mice had themselves been exterminated by the
plague.</p>

<p class='c007'>Plague, which formerly was the most terrible of epidemic
diseases, has now become a misfortune against which it is
simple to guard ourselves. To secure that end, however,
we have not to pray or to scourge ourselves, but to take
measures to destroy rats and mice. Moreover serums may
be employed; and the use of these is not only prophylactic,
but if the disease be not too advanced, is actually curative.
The danger of which Schopenhauer spoke may be regarded
as definitely averted, and this is due to the advance of
medical knowledge. In such countries as British India in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>which plague still causes great losses, we have to blame
the ignorance of the population. Instead of following
the course prescribed by science, these people still prefer
the rules laid down by the Brahmanistic religion. Their
idea of cleanliness and purity is a religious idea, and not
that of medicine and bacteriology. It is not surprising
that plague still exists in India, but none the less no case
is a better instance of the progress of knowledge.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hartmann’s idea as to a progressive increase in the
number of diseases rests on no exact grounds, and is in
opposition to much that we know. As a matter of fact, as
knowledge of hygiene advances and becomes spread among
the peoples, diseases become less frequent and less fatal.</p>

<p class='c007'>A great stimulus was given to medicine and surgery when
there was applied to these the knowledge gained by Pasteur
in his study of fermentation. Pasteur showed that fermentations
were chemical alterations in organic matter, excited
by the presence of minute organisms very common in the
neighbourhood of man.</p>

<p class='c007'>This discovery was applied in the first place to surgery.
Lord Lister, then a surgeon in Scotland, showed that the
festering of wounds was due to the entrance of minute
organisms. Following this clue, he succeeded, by the use
of dressings, in preventing the contamination of wounds
and at once saw a vast reduction in deaths following surgical
operations. Since the discovery of anæsthetics, such as
ether, chloroform, and cocaine, and the use of germ-free
dressings, surgery has been developed in a marvellous
fashion. The varied and delicate feats of abdominal
operation are known to all, and recently surgery of the
heart has become possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>A comparison of the mortality of the wounded in the
different wars of the nineteenth century affords an excellent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>means of gauging the progress of surgical treatment of gunshot
wounds. The mortality of the wounded among the
English troops in the Crimean war reached 15.21 per cent.;
in the French troops in Italy in 1859–1860, it was 17.36
per cent.; in the German army in 1870–1871, the years
in which antiseptic surgery came into use, it fell to 11.07
per cent.; while in the Spanish-American war in 1898,
in the most brilliant period of modern surgery, the percentage
mortality of wounded had fallen to 6.64.<a id='r267'></a><a href='#f267' class='c014'><sup>[267]</sup></a> In the recent
Transvaal war, the mortality was half what it had been
in the Franco-German war.<a id='r268'></a><a href='#f268' class='c014'><sup>[268]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>New medical knowledge, founded on the discovery of
the nature of ferments and of the virus of infection, has
reformed the practice of midwifery to such an extent that
puerperal fever, formerly one of the great scourges of
humanity, is now extremely rare.</p>

<p class='c007'>Blindness acquired at birth, which formerly rendered
many lives extremely miserable, is now practically completely
prevented, by means of the precautions taken to
hinder the child from being contaminated by the mother
in the process of birth. The most successful method is that
which was suggested by Credé,<a id='r269'></a><a href='#f269' class='c014'><sup>[269]</sup></a> a German physician, and
consists in placing in the pupils of the infant a minute drop
of nitrate of silver, which is an antiseptic, and prevents
the occurrence of ocular blennorrhagia.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>Appendicitis, a disease so common that I referred to it
in chap. iv. as one of the most salient examples of disharmony
in the human constitution, has been resolutely
attacked by medical science. In some cases, surgical interference
makes a definite end of the disease; in other
cases medical treatment has been enough to subdue the
symptoms without recourse to operation.</p>

<p class='c007'>For a considerable period, those of a sceptical disposition
asserted that the advance of bacteriological knowledge
was of service only in surgical cases. But Pasteur showed
that this was an erroneous view. Working with Chamberland
and Roux, Pasteur demonstrated that many infectious
diseases could be prevented by the use of attenuated virus;
he succeeded in saving the lives of many animals and of
men, bitten by rabid dogs and affected by hydrophobia,
a disease formerly almost invariably fatal and among the
most horrible to which man is liable.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the latter direction, medical science is developing
at an extraordinary rate, and is achieving results of a remarkable
nature. Among recent discoveries, I may mention
that of the curative properties of the blood serum of animals
which have been subjected to the action either of microbes
or of the soluble products of microbes. Von Behring,
working with the Kitasato, a Japanese investigator, has
shown that a serum of this nature, prepared with the poison
produced by the microbe of diphtheria (the poison was
discovered by Roux in collaboration with Yersin), is capable
not only of protecting those in good health from diphtheria,
but of curing those who have been attacked by the disease.
The serum fails to act only when it is employed in advanced
cases of diphtheria.</p>

<p class='c007'>Anti-diphtheritic serum, introduced into medical practice
about eight years ago, has been tried in every way and has
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>been proved to possess both preventive and curative properties.
If patients still die from diphtheria, it is only because
the treatment has been applied too late or insufficiently.</p>

<p class='c007'>The use of the anti-diphtheritic serum has reduced the
mortality in cases of diphtheria from 50 or even 60 per
cent. to 12 or 14 per cent. The number of infant lives
that have been saved by this method must be enormous.</p>

<p class='c007'>The beneficent discovery of the curative value of serums
has been applied to other diseases and is giving very encouraging
results. I cannot go into details here, but it is
enough to say that in the last quarter of a century medicine
has entered a new epoch, and has taken its place among
other exact sciences based on the experimental method.
Although it is not surprising that in so short a space of time
science has not yet conquered all the ills affecting humanity,
this failure has provoked the most severe criticism.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Indeed,” one of the critics has said, “you vaunt the
progress of medical science at a time when you have to
confess that it has failed to cure tuberculosis, one of the
gravest of the infectious diseases, which alone causes the
death of a sixth part of the human race.” It is true that
the infectious nature of this scourge was announced by
Villemin more than forty years ago. Twenty years have
passed since Koch, the German bacteriologist, discovered the
microbe that produces not only the ordinary form of pulmonary
consumption but all other varieties of tuberculosis.
And we are still ignorant of any remedy for the disease.
In all the bacteriological institutes and laboratories search
is being made for some vaccine or serum or medicament
which will arrest a disease that in many cases nature herself
cures. But the results amount practically to nothing.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is certainly a good example of the failure of science.
None the less a closer examination shows that even with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>the knowledge already gained we could deal with tuberculosis
in a manner more efficacious than is the existing practice.
When the infectious nature of the disease had been
made known, before waiting for the discovery by Koch
of the actual bacillus, we should have employed all the
known modes of destroying infectious matter. In spite
of all that has been said and written on the subject, people
still spit on the floors of omnibuses and cars and on street
pavements. Tuberculosis is propagated not because of
the failure of science, but because of the ignorance and
stupidity of the population. To diminish the spread of
tuberculosis, of typhoid fever, of dysentery, and of many
other diseases, it is necessary only to follow the rules of
scientific hygiene, without waiting for specific remedies.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although the science of to-day is sufficiently armed
against the diseases commonly known as infectious, the case
is very different with some other affections, among which
the chief place is taken by malignant tumours, or cancers,
in the most general sense of the word.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are few maladies more terrible, for they practically
never disappear spontaneously, and surgery can
remove them successfully only if they have been recognised
at an early stage. Every year a number of persons, old
and young, die victims of malignant tumours, and it is even
possible that cancer is more prevalent now than in former
times. It has been suggested that the increase of cancer
is due to the greater longevity among modern races, and
as malignant tumours are most common in old persons,
it may well be that the prolongation of life has given this
disease a larger field. However, even allowing for this,
it is probable that there is a real increase of cancer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Unquestionably the malignant tumours are the diseases
most disappointing to medicine and surgery, and these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>sciences are as much at a loss with regard to them as in the
case of infectious diseases before the discovery of pathogenic
organisms. Science is perhaps even in worse case with
regard to cancer than it formerly was with regard to infectious
diseases, for, before the discovery of microbes, something
was known of the virus which produces infection.
Thus the virus of smallpox was known, and was used, by
the method of inoculation, to prevent more serious attacks
of the disease. Nearly a century before the discoveries
of Pasteur, Jenner had been able to be of the greatest service
to mankind by his discovery that the virus of cow-pox
could be used as a preventive of infection by smallpox.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the case of malignant tumours, we do not even know
their real nature; we are ignorant as to whether or no they
are infectious, and whether they are caused by a microbe
coming from without or are due to internal changes of the
tissues. Our ignorance, however, affords no ground for
despair. It is probable that the malignant tumours will
soon come to be ranged with infectious diseases due to
invasions by specific microbes. Experiments on the cancers
in rats and mice have shown that these can be inoculated
in the same manner as in the case of the recognised infectious
diseases. Hanau has shown that this occurs in the case
of epithelioma of old rats; Morau<a id='r270'></a><a href='#f270' class='c014'><sup>[270]</sup></a> has succeeded in transferring
the cancers of white mice, and his results have been
confirmed by Jensen<a id='r271'></a><a href='#f271' class='c014'><sup>[271]</sup></a> and Borr<a id='r272'></a><a href='#f272' class='c014'><sup>[272]</sup></a>, in the Institut Pasteur.
These investigations mark the beginning of a new stage in
the knowledge of tumours. I am unable to see, therefore
that the malignant tumours provide a satisfactory argument
in favour of a pessimistic conception of the universe.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>Dr. Boas, of Berlin,<a id='r273'></a><a href='#f273' class='c014'><sup>[273]</sup></a> in a recent publication, has laid
stress on the fact that most patients affected with cancer
do not seek medical aid until the disease is far advanced.
For instance, in 80 per cent. of the cases of cancer of the
rectum that he had attended, the patients presented themselves
too late for operation. Boas advised that the attention
of the public should be drawn, by means of widespread
publication, to the earliest symptoms of cancerous disease.
He thought that such a course might save many lives by
making possible operation in early stages.</p>

<p class='c007'>The prevention and treatment of disease, which for long
was in the hands of religious authorities, is now passing
into the care of those who employ the methods of scientific
medicine. It is now only in the case of certain nervous
maladies, which can be treated by suggestion, that religion
has any important part to play. I have not thought it
necessary to expound at length the work of science in the
struggle against disease, because the evidence on this point
is extremely clear and precise. Every one must accept it,
and even the passionate enemies of science have to bow
before the fact.</p>

<p class='c007'>However, the problem has been changed. Science they
now admit, is capable, no doubt, of assuaging humanity
in its sufferings from this or the other disease. But there
is another question. Disease is only an episode in human
life, and the great problems remain unsolved by science.
It is not enough to cure a man of diphtheria or intermittent
fever; it is necessary to explain what the destiny of man
is, and why he must grow old and die at a time when his
desire to live is strongest. Here, plainly, all science must
fail, and here must begin the beneficent work of religion
and philosophy. But as science is constantly casting doubt
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>on the dogmas of religion, and criticising adversely the
systems of philosophy, it is plain, that so far from being
of service, science is actually harmful to mankind.</p>

<p class='c007'>The campaign against science was opened long ago. In
the eighteenth century Rousseau<a id='r274'></a><a href='#f274' class='c014'><sup>[274]</sup></a> opened it with brilliancy
and zest worthy of his reputation. He defended his theme
with vigour and eloquence and the following quotations
may serve as an example, “Know O people,” he wrote,
“that nature has desired to preserve you from science as
a mother tries to snatch a dangerous weapon from the
hands of her child; that the secrets which she has hidden
from you are evils from which she would preserve you, and
that one of her greatest gifts is the difficulty with which
knowledge is acquired. Human beings are perverse, but
they would have been worse had they had the misfortune
to be born learned men.<a id='r275'></a><a href='#f275' class='c014'><sup>[275]</sup></a> Our sciences are futile in so far
as they fail to attain their objects, but they are worse than
futile in the results that they bring about. Born of idleness,
they cherish their mother—Tell me, illustrious philosophers,
you from whom we know why matter attracts
matter, the relations of the orbits traced by revolving
planets, the mathematical properties of curves, what stars
may be inhabited, what insects exhibit curious modes of
reproduction; tell me, I say, you from whom we have gained
such marvellous information, if you had never learned of
these things, should we have been less numerous, less well
governed, less flourishing, or worse disposed?”<a id='r276'></a><a href='#f276' class='c014'><sup>[276]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Such words were capable of impressing men because of
their eloquence and sincerity, but they could not arrest
the continued and triumphant advance of science, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>indeed, precisely at the end of the eighteenth century,
began its modern and lasting progress. For it was then
that Laplace described the system of the heavens and that
Lavoisier laid the foundation of modern chemistry and of
our knowledge of the indestructibility of matter.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the nineteenth century, science has made a revolution
in life by its application of steam and by its other triumphs.
None the less it has not satisfied many distinguished persons.
And to-day we find a writer of genius, in the manner of
Rousseau, raising his voice against the science of the nineteenth
century.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tolstoi, in an essay of which the title is, “On the Aim of
Science and Art,” has attempted to show the incompetence
of science with regard to the great problems that occupy
humanity. The task set himself by the Russian writer
was much harder than that of Rousseau, for with the passing
of a century science has become much more powerful.</p>

<p class='c007'>Tolstoi is convinced that theoretical investigations into
the origin of life, the intimate structure of living matter
and so forth, are of no importance to human beings, and
serve no other purpose than to flatter the pretensions of
the learned. “All that we call culture,” he affirmed,
“our sciences, our arts, improvements in the amenity of
life, are no other than attempts to deceive the moral
cravings of mankind; all that we call hygiene and medicine
are no other than attempts to deceive the physical and
natural cravings of mankind.”<a id='r277'></a><a href='#f277' class='c014'><sup>[277]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The whole progress of science “up to the present time,
has not only not improved the lot of the majority of mankind,
that is to say of the labourers, but has made it worse.”<a id='r278'></a><a href='#f278' class='c014'><sup>[278]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>Tolstoi thinks that the epithet “true science” could be
given only to “knowledge of the right aim and true
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>happiness of each individual and of mankind as a whole.
Such a science would serve as a guiding thread in determining
the proper sphere of all knowledge”; “without knowledge
of the proper aim of life and of the real good of humanity,
all other knowledge and every art become merely amusements
idle or even harmful.”<a id='r279'></a><a href='#f279' class='c014'><sup>[279]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The chief grievance of the great Russian writer against
knowledge, culture, and progress can be resolved into the
powerlessness of these to explain the most difficult problems
of humanity, that is to say the real aim of human life, and
what really constitutes true happiness.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this connection, Tolstoi gives expression to a view
which is shared by many thinkers. Some years later,
Brunetière,<a id='r280'></a><a href='#f280' class='c014'><sup>[280]</sup></a> a well-known French writer and public man,
under the influence of a recent journey to Rome and visit
to the Pope, made public a similar opinion, and proclaimed
aloud the fallibility of science.</p>

<p class='c007'>Brunetière made his criticism as follows: “For the last
two or three centuries, science has promised to change the
face of the earth, to dispel every mystery; she has not done
so. She is powerless to resolve the sole problems that are
essential, that concern the origin of man, the rules for his
conduct, and his future destiny. We know now that
natural science can teach us none of these matters. Thus,
in the battle between science and religion, science has been
defeated, because she has had to admit her powerlessness
precisely where religion is most strong. For religion gives
the solutions that science has failed to supply. Religion
teaches us what we can learn neither from anatomy nor from
physiology, that is to say, what we are, whither we are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>going, and how we ought to act. Religion and science
supplement each other; and, as science can do nothing
for morality, it becomes the duty of religion to take her
place.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It has been replied to Brunetière, that his recriminations
are unfounded, first, because science has never undertaken
to solve the great problems of the aim of life and the proper
basis of morality; next, because it is probable that these
problems will never be solved by the human understanding.
Charles Richet, a well-known French physiologist, made
a vain effort to find any written evidence that science had
promised to solve the great problems which have absorbed
the attention of Tolstoi and Brunetière as well as of quite
a large section of humanity. “In what standard works
has science made the astonishing promises that M. Brunetière
recalls with so much bitterness?” asked Richet.<a id='r281'></a><a href='#f281' class='c014'><sup>[281]</sup></a>
“I have now before me,” he proceeded, “the Manuel du
baccalauréat ès sciences (Guide to a Degree in Science).
It is a summary of contemporary scientific ideas. I have
looked through it in vain for promises—it contains no
promises.”<a id='r282'></a><a href='#f282' class='c014'><sup>[282]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The promises referred to must be looked for in scientific
treatises that deal in generalisations. It is not to be disputed
that, since the renaissance in Europe of the rational
and sceptical spirit, that is to say, in the last two or three
centuries, the view has been proclaimed that all human life
may be regulated by natural laws without the interposition
of dogmas, either metaphysical or religious. Attempts
of this kind have been numerous. Büchner, in his treatise
on “Force and Matter,” in which he tried to give a general
conception of the universe based on the scientific knowledge
of the nineteenth century, made very plain statements on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>this point. “We must seek the foundation of morality,”
said the German populariser, “elsewhere than in the timeworn
and fantastic belief in the supernatural. Science
must replace religion; belief in the real existence of a
natural and immutable order in things must displace belief
in spirits and ghosts; natural moral law must take the
place of artificial or dogmatic morality.”<a id='r283'></a><a href='#f283' class='c014'><sup>[283]</sup></a> Büchner even
tried to indicate what natural morality is. According to
him it is “the law of mutual consideration of the equal rights
of each person, both from the general and the individual
point of view, so as to assure the greatest happiness of the
greatest number. Everything that damages or destroys
the common good is ‘evil;’ everything that favours it is
‘good.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>The other question, as to whither we are going, finds an
answer in the materialistic and scientific breviary of Büchner.
He disputes the idea of immortality, which has been supported
by nearly all the religions, and comes to the conclusion
that there is nothing appalling to a man, “imbued
with the principles of philosophy, in the conception of the
annihilation of the individual life.” “Annihilation is perfect
rest; it is freedom from all pain and escape from the sensations
that torture the body and the mind—as was explained
so clearly in the great religion of Buddha; it is
not to be feared, but rather to be coveted when life has
reached its normal term and when old age has come with
its inevitable assemblage of infirmities.”</p>

<p class='c007'>I do not wish to suggest that the views I have just quoted
are peculiar to Büchner. That writer has served to a large
extent as the mouthpiece of ideas current among the
materialistic and positivist men of science of his time.
In Haeckel’s book, “The Riddle of the Universe,” which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>appeared nearly half a century after the first edition of
“Force and Matter,” the same ideas are to be found. He
also has found answers to the questions that absorb mankind.
In his opinion also, as I have shown in chap. v.
the problem of natural morality resolves itself into the
social instincts of man, and has nothing to do with religious
dogma. As for the destiny of man, he concludes as
follows: “The best end we can desire after a courageous life,
spent in doing good according to our light, is the eternal
peace of the grave.”<a id='r284'></a><a href='#f284' class='c014'><sup>[284]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>There is a very close resemblance between the views of
the two great popularisers of the nineteenth century. Just
as Büchner, to show the stupidity of the idea of eternal life,
repeated the legend of the “Wandering Jew,” so Haeckel,
with the same object, related the legend of the unhappy
“Ahasuerus” who sought death vainly, finding his eternal
life intolerable. “However gloriously we may depict this
eternal life in paradise, in the end it would be a fearful
burden to the best of men.”</p>

<p class='c007'>While there is no doubt but that such ideas are shared
by many men who rely on scientific arguments, there are
others to whom the problem presents itself differently.
The German physiologist, Du Bois Reymond, after reflecting
on the general problems of knowledge and the universe,
proclaimed an “Ignorabimus” as a warning that a whole
series of problems of the highest importance to humanity
were outside the range of human knowledge and incapable
of solution. These problems were precisely the seven
“riddles of the universe” that Haeckel claimed to have
solved in his book.</p>

<p class='c007'>Many learned men think that the great problems, those,
according to Tolstoi, that constitute the only true science,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>can never be solved. “Every day there comes a new
conquest,” said Richet,<a id='r285'></a><a href='#f285' class='c014'><sup>[285]</sup></a> “but we are no nearer solution
of the ultimate enigma, the destiny of human life, an enigma
probably never to be solved.” Philosophers have taken
the same view. “It cannot be from science,” said Guyau,
“that personality is to require the proofs of its own durability.”<a id='r286'></a><a href='#f286' class='c014'><sup>[286]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The answers given by science as it exists to-day, have
failed to console the spirits that have applied to her. When
Richet, in the discussion on the “bankruptcy of science”
recalled the discovery of treatment of diphtheria by specific
serums as an instance of the value of scientific research,
Brunetière replied, “Serum therapy cannot prevent us
from dying, nor tell us why we must die.” The problem of
death always recurs. What is the use of saving the life
of a child smitten by diphtheria only that it may grow up,
and by learning the inevitability of death become filled with
terror?</p>

<p class='c007'>If science be really powerless before the gravest problems
that torture mankind, if she has to excuse herself by admitting
her incompetence, if she can do no better than to extol
the silent annihilation of the grave, it is not surprising that
many minds and these not the least capable, turn from
her. The desire to find some consolation in the miseries
of a purposeless existence throws them into the arms of
religion or metaphysics. Here lies the explanation of the
actual return in these days to faith. People plunge into
mysticism hoping to find there something more comforting
than the annihilation offered by science.</p>

<p class='c007'>In all ranks of modern society there are signs of this
craving for the supernatural. It is therefore extremely
interesting to follow the intimate steps of such an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>abandonment of science and return to faith. The
“Confessions” of Tolstoi gave one of the best examples of
the metamorphosis.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having reached the conclusion that life is meaningless
because it cannot be harmonised with the fear of death and
the prospect of absolute annihilation, Tolstoi (see chap.
vi.) asked if it were not possible to solve the great problem
of human existence by means of the facts of science. “I
searched in all the sciences,” he said, “and not only found
nothing myself, but became convinced that all who sought
would find nothing. Not only would they find nothing,
but they would see clearly precisely what had driven me
to despair, the fact that the absurdity of life is the sole
indisputable bit of knowledge open to man.” “For a long
time, observing the grave and solemn tones of the exact
sciences, which indeed, hardly touched the problem of life,
it seemed to me that they must be concealing something
that I did not understand.”</p>

<p class='c007'>All the while, the question that Tolstoi put to himself
seemed simple enough: “Why am I to keep alive? Why
am I to do anything?” or, in another way: “Has life any
object that is not destroyed by the inevitable death that
awaits me? To the one question, put in many ways, I
sought an answer in human knowledge.” “From my
earliest youth the speculative sciences interested me deeply.
Later on, the mathematical and physical sciences attracted
me, and until my question rose up clearly before me, day
by day growing larger, and imperatively demanding an
answer, until then I was satisfied with the semblance of
an answer given by science.” “I said to myself; everything
is evolving, differentiating, moving towards complexity
and amelioration, and the progress is under the
guidance of law. You, you yourself are part of this whole.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>“Although I am deeply ashamed to confess it, there was
a time when I thought myself content with these things.
My muscles grew and became stronger. My memory added
to its stores. My ability for thinking and understanding
increased. I grew and developed, and feeling the growth
within me, it seemed natural to believe that the solution
of my own life was given by the law of the whole universe.
But the time came when I stopped growing. I felt that I
was no longer developing and even that I was slipping back.
My muscles weakened; my teeth dropped out; and I felt
that this law not only explained nothing, not only had never
explained anything, but had not been a law at all; that in
fact I had taken for a law what I found in myself at a
particular stage of my life.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“As I found no explanation in science,” Tolstoi went
on, in his poignant narrative, “I began to look for the
answer in life, hoping to find it in the men around me.”
“My intellect was at work, but also something else, something
that I can call only the consciousness of life, like some
strong force that compelled my intellect to turn in another
direction and to rescue me from my desperate condition.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The new direction was the feeling of faith. “However
I might put to myself the question: how must I live?
the answer was—by the law of God. Whither tends my
present life? To eternal pain or to blessedness everlasting.
How is my life not destroyed by death? By eternal union
with God, by heaven. And thus I was led inevitably to
see that quite independently of human knowledge, which
formerly seemed to me the only guide, mankind had another
guide, a guide that is irrational; faith which makes life
possible. Faith seemed to be as irrational as ever, but I could
not but recognise that faith alone gave mankind an answer
to the problem of life, and in consequence made life possible.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>Reason had led me to the conviction that life was absurd,
and so, there being no longer a reason to live, I had wished
to kill myself. Looking at mankind as a whole, I saw that
men kept alive by assuring themselves that they saw a
meaning in life. I myself came back to that point of view.
I had reached a time when there seemed to me to be no
meaning in life. But as to other men, so to me, life and the
possibility of living were offered by faith.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Driven in the direction of faith, Tolstoi reached the
following conclusion: “The object of a man’s life is the
salvation of his soul; for that, we must live in God, and to
live in God it is necessary to give up the pleasures of life,
to work, to submit, to suffer and to be charitable.” And
this conclusion led to the other that “a faith has value in
so far as it gives a meaning to life which is not destroyed
by death.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It is plain then that all this evolution, the beginning of
which was the fear of death, ended in belief in something
beyond death. And it is also plain why Tolstoi should
have been as bitter against science as I have shown him to
be. Tolstoi does not afford the only example of a case
where the failure of science to solve the problem of death
has led to the abandonment of science in favour of religion.
Brunetière, if it is possible to judge from his published
writings, traversed similar paths in his journey to the
Catholic religion.</p>

<p class='c007'>However, even an intellect so positive and so sceptical
as that of Zola has been unable to resist the lures of faith.
There is a very interesting note on this subject in the <cite>Journal</cite>
of de Goncourt, dated February 20, 1883. “To-night,
after dinner, at the foot of the bedstead of carved wood,
where coffee was served, Zola began to talk of death, on
which his thoughts have been fixed more than ever since
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>the death of his mother. After a short silence, he said
that death had made an in-road on the nihilism of his
religious convictions, as he could not face the possibility
of an eternal separation.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In strata of society less impregnated with rational and
scientific thought, it is plain that the return to religion
must be more common. I recall the case of a woman of
the people, a workwoman, who declared that she formerly
had had no belief, but that, since the birth of her son, she
had begun to believe in the good God, as she was convinced
that it was only by such a belief that she could guard the
life of her child from the evils of the world.</p>

<p class='c007'>As things are, it is not wonderful that many people
decline to educate their children in an exclusively scientific
spirit, which is destructive to faith, as they cannot substitute
for faith something equally consoling. Perhaps ideas of
this kind lie behind the story of the apple of the Garden
of Eden and the invention of the words of Jahveh: “But
of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt
not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou
shalt surely die” (Genesis ii. 17). The legend of Prometheus,
who stole fire from heaven, and was chained to a
rock, is in the same category.</p>

<p class='c007'>Solomon gave voice to the same idea, in the clearest way,
in his words: “I communed with mine own heart, saying,
Lo, I am come to great estate, and have gotten more wisdom
than all they that have been before me in Jerusalem; yea,
my heart had great experience of wisdom and knowledge.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness
and folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of
spirit.</p>

<p class='c007'>“For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth
knowledge, increaseth sorrow” (Ecclesiastes, i. 16).</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>Much later, Shakespeare offered to us in <em>Hamlet</em>, the
type of a man very highly cultivated, in whom reason and
reflection had arrested action. As he could not solve by
reason the problems that haunted him, he asked if it were
worth while to remain alive. Then followed the famous
lines:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Thus conscience does make cowards of us all,</div>
      <div class='line'>And thus the native hue of resolution</div>
      <div class='line'>Is sicklied o’er with the pale cast of thought.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>As so many men of genius have taken the same point
of view, it becomes necessary to inquire carefully as to
whether or no too much knowledge be harmful to human
happiness. If science do no more than to destroy faith and
to teach us that the whole living world is moving towards
a knowledge of inevitable old age and death, it becomes
necessary to ask if the perilous march of science should
not be stayed. Is it that the attraction of mankind to
knowledge is as dangerous to the race, as the attraction
of moths to the light is fatal to these wretched insects?
The question demands an exact answer. But before giving
the verdict, the facts of the case must be examined. I
shall proceed to this in the chapters to follow.</p>

  <h3 class='c001'>CHAPTER X<br> <span class='c012'>INTRODUCTION TO THE SCIENTIFIC STUDY OF OLD AGE</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c006'>While I cannot share the views of those who turn from
science to seek truth and consolation in religion, it would
be wrong to ignore or to be indifferent to the existence of
that attitude. There are men who are tormented by the
contradiction between the desire of life and the inevitability
of death, and when these demand some solution of the problem,
it is unreasonable merely to say that they are too
exacting and should learn contentment.</p>

<p class='c007'>If a man complains to his physician of uncontrollable
hunger and thirst, he is not told that it is wrong to be so
greedy, and that that fault could be mastered by strength
of mind. The doctor carefully examines the patient and
does what he can for the distressing symptoms, which,
indeed, in this case are generally due to diabetes. Those who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>hunger and thirst after eternal life, ought to be similarly
treated by men of science whose duty it is to ameliorate
their sufferings as much as possible.</p>

<p class='c007'>Science has undoubtedly gone far in the successful treatment
of disease, both as regards prevention and cure, but
it is powerless before those other evils from which Buddha
implored his father to grant him exemption—old age and
death. Science has attained to heights of knowledge
undreamed of by Buddha’s father, King Couddhôdana,
and yet it knows no more than he did with regard to the
problem of old age and death. Like the king, science can
but reply to its questioners: “You ask the impossible.
I cannot help you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Not only is no remedy for old age known to science,
but little or nothing is known with regard to that period
in the lives of men and animals. It was no easy task to
compress an account of the present position of medicine
within a few pages, the subject matter being overwhelming
in quantity. With regard to old age it is quite the contrary,
our knowledge being so limited that the subject may be
dealt with in a few lines. With the advance of years, man
and the higher animals undergo important modifications.
They become weaker, the body shrinks, the hair whitens,
and the teeth decay; in fact, all the phenomena connected
with senile decay manifest themselves.</p>

<p class='c007'>At this period of life which overtakes various species
of animals at different ages, the body becomes an easy
prey to pernicious influences and diseases. The direct cause
of death cannot always be determined, and is attributed
to the general breaking up of the system which we call
natural death. The first question which presents itself
to the scientific mind is whether this degeneration or senile
decay is proper only to man and the higher animals, or is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>common to all forms of life. We have all seen very old
trees, the appearance of which proclaims their age. The
trunk is decayed, the bark gnarled, the branches shrivelled,
and the leaves scanty. Some kinds of trees live for hundreds—possibly
thousands—of years, while others age with
comparative rapidity. Senile decay is not
unknown in the vegetable kingdom, and its
presence is suspected even among creatures
of very simple organisation belonging to
the group of infusoria. These creatures
may be reared with ease in vessels containing
macerations of chopped hay or
leaves. They multiply by means of division
(Fig. 12), an operation which takes
place at very short intervals, some of
them dividing nearly every hour. Owing
to this rapid multiplication the vessels
soon become full of a mass of infusoria.
M. Maupas,<a id='r287'></a><a href='#f287' class='c014'><sup>[287]</sup></a> a very distinguished zoologist,
observed that the infusoria became
smaller and smaller after a number of
generations, exhausting themselves, as it
were, and perishing unless two individuals succeed in
uniting. This process of “conjugation” (Fig. 13), involves
an exchange of portions of the bodies of the two creatures
and brings about a complete rejuvenescence of the two
individuals. After conjugation, a process essentially similar
to the details of sexual fertilisation, the infusoria resume
the normal appearance and again become capable of reproduction
by simple division for many generations.</p>

<div  class='figleft id005'>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 12.</span> Paramecium about to divide in two.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The periodical debility, which precedes conjugation is,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>according to Maupas, an instance of senile degeneration
among infusoria. He has recognised its existence in the
case of many species of the higher infusoria (<em>Ciliata</em>), but
while this phenomenon has been observed in the case of
many other simple organisms, it cannot be set down as
universal among microscopic beings. Among bacteria, a
group that includes the greater number of pathogenic organisms,
conjugation has been very
rarely observed. Even the largest
kinds, such as, for instance, the
<em>anthrax</em> bacillus, may be propagated
for a long series of generations
without the occurrence of
conjugation.</p>

<div  class='figright id003'>
<img src='images/fig_13.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 13.</span> Conjugation of two Paramecia (after Bütschli).</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Even in the case of the infusoria
which by means of the process of
conjugation can reproduce indefinitely,
the preconjugal debility
cannot be identified with the senile
degeneration of human beings, the
higher animals and trees. In all
these debility is the antecedent, not of conjugation and
rejuvenescence, but of the end of life.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another important difference is that in the case of infusoria
the preconjugal debility does not occur in every
individual, as is the case with the animals and plants which
display real old age. In the infusoria an indefinite number
of generations occur between the individuals that display
debility and those that are ready for conjugation.</p>

<p class='c007'>If, in spite of these differences, we were to insist on the
existence of an essential resemblance between senile degeneration
in man and preconjugal debility in infusoria, it
would be enough to reflect on the result of applying to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>case of man what is an infallible remedy in the case of the
infusoria. For conjugation brings about a real rejuvenescence
of the infusoria and a similar event in the case
of man would only increase the debility. Moreover,
according to recent investigations of Calkins,<a id='r288'></a><a href='#f288' class='c014'><sup>[288]</sup></a> infusoria,
weakened by degeneration, may become young again not
only by conjugating with their kind, but by the addition
of bouillon or extract of brain to the medium in which
they live.</p>

<p class='c007'>Real old age is a phase of existence in which the natural
forces abate never to be renewed. In animals, the life
cycle of which is very definite, the signs of senile degeneration
are not visible. Insects, in the adult condition, very
often live only a short time, and die without displaying the
slightest mark of age. In the case of lower vertebrates,
old age is little known, and has few signs. On the other
hand, mammals and birds display senile atrophy in a
marked fashion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some species of birds live to a great age, longevity being
more common than among mammals. Cases in which birds
such as geese, swans, ravens, and some birds of prey, have
been known to reach the age of fifty years,<a id='r289'></a><a href='#f289' class='c014'><sup>[289]</sup></a> are not uncommon,
whereas such an event is very rare in the case of a mammal.
Even small birds, such as canaries, may live as long
as twenty years. Parrots are especially long-lived birds.
Cockatoos have been known to reach the age of eighty
years and more. I myself have had opportunities of observing
a South American parakeet (<em>Chrysotis amazonica</em>) which
lived more than eighty-two years, longer than is usual even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>with parrakeets. Several years before it died the bird
showed unmistakable signs of old age. It became less
lively, its plumage, although it did not whiten, lost much
of its brightness, and the joints of the claws showed evidence
of the presence of disease. In short, the parrakeet was
obviously worn out and debilitated.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mammals show the signs of age even more plainly than
do birds. A dog reveals old age by its slow movements,
its white hairs, and worn teeth. The appearance of such
an animal is never agreeable, while it is often dirty and ill-tempered.
Brehm describes the old age of a dog as follows:
“At twelve years of age a dog has grown old, and his gait
and whole organisation show signs of age. The coat is no
longer glossy; the forehead and muzzle are grey, the teeth
are blunted or have fallen out. The animal is lazy and
apathetic. Many such dogs are dumb and blind. Dogs
may live for twenty, six and twenty, or even thirty years,
but such cases are most unusual.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As the dog is a domesticated animal, it might be argued
that its old age, with its manifest signs of decrepitude, is
the result of the artificial conditions of its life. To decide
on this point it is necessary to examine an instance of old
age in a wild animal. This presents certain difficulties since
wild animals when old and feeble become an easy prey to
carnivorous enemies. It will best serve our present purpose
to consider such information as has been collected regarding
the period of old age in anthropoid apes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The natives of Borneo have observed “old orangs, which
have not only lost their teeth, but being too feeble to climb,
live on the fallen fruits and herbs.”<a id='r290'></a><a href='#f290' class='c014'><sup>[290]</sup></a> Gorillas, according
to Savage, turn grey in their old age, from which has arisen
the erroneous view that there are two species of the gorilla.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>In their wild state, monkeys, like ourselves, are subject
in their old age to various distressing ailments. Senile
degeneration, then, which is universally looked upon as
one of the greatest evils of life, is by no means restricted
to the human race. Old age, as portrayed in the Buddhist
legend, referred to in chap. vi., is perhaps somewhat
exaggerated, but this period of life is undoubtedly characterised
by changes of such a nature as considerably to
affect the happiness of the old. Buddha, being a pessimist,
took too dark a view of this, but let us hear what optimists
have to say on the subject. Max Nordau, a doctor, a
writer of books and a journalist, says: “Physically speaking,
an old man presents an unpleasant picture of decrepitude
to the casual observer. Morally speaking, he is a blind
and pitiless egotist, having lost all interest in anything
outside himself. Intellectually he becomes feeble-minded
and narrow in his views, being governed by antiquated
notions and prejudices, and incapable of grasping new
ideas.”<a id='r291'></a><a href='#f291' class='c014'><sup>[291]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>It may be objected that I am here supporting my argument
by quoting from a writer who, in his capacity of
clever journalist, rather forces the note. Let me therefore
refer to what a learned physiologist said when addressing
a serious audience assembled for the purpose of obtaining
truth and information from his lips. After dealing in broad
outline with the physical degeneracy caused by old age,
Longet<a id='r292'></a><a href='#f292' class='c014'><sup>[292]</sup></a> draws the following mental picture: “The old
feel that their task in life is accomplished, and believe themselves
to be universally grudged the space they occupy in
the world. This renders them suspicious of all around
them, and jealous of the young. Their craving for solitude
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>and the uncertainty of their tempers are due to the same
cause. All old people are not like this, of course. The
hearts of some remain youthful and beat strongly within
their feeble frames, but, as a general rule, they are morose
and a nuisance to themselves and others, excepting when
they are surrounded by their children or grandchildren,
who like to listen to them about the past, and who make
excuses for the present. Thus the years speed onward,
every round of the clock bringing the end nearer, and every
hour adding a new wrinkle to their faces, some fresh weakness
and some new regret. Their bodies&#160;... become
decrepit; their backbones, too weak to hold them upright,
curve over and bend them downwards towards the earth.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There can be no doubt but that the period of old age is
sad, and a thorough knowledge of it is necessary before it
can be understood. Disease can only be successfully dealt
with when the cause of its presence is known, and so it is
with old age.</p>

<p class='c007'>Is it possible, one might ask, at the present stage of the
world’s knowledge, to define, with even approximate accuracy,
the characteristic features of senile decay? The task
is difficult, for although the subject is very important, few
facts have been collected.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is common knowledge that the flesh of old animals,
used as food, is tough. An old fowl cannot be compared
with a tender and juicy chicken. Organs such as the liver
and kidneys are much harder in the case of old animals.
The horny flesh of old animals is often compared with
boot-leather. Although the comparison does not pretend
to be scientific, it is far from being incorrect. Boot-leather
is made from the hides of animals; that is to say, of a very
resistant material that is called “connective tissue,” and
which consists of a dense mass of fibres, mingled with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>living elements or “connective tissue” cells. This tissue
is very durable and so is employed for boots and shoes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The infiltration of any organ with connective tissue makes
it tough and unpalatable. This hardening is called a
<em>sclerosis</em> (of the liver, kidneys, &#38;c.). In old age many
organs exhibit this tendency to hardening or sclerotic degeneration.
The fact has been known for long, but its significance
has been perceived more recently. Demange,<a id='r293'></a><a href='#f293' class='c014'><sup>[293]</sup></a> in
his monograph on the organic changes associated with old
age, states as follows: “Besides atrophy and degeneration
of the parenchymatous elements,<a id='r294'></a><a href='#f294' class='c014'><sup>[294]</sup></a> there is to be observed
a profound change in the framework of connective tissue,
which serves to support the organs. In some cases the
skeletal framework of an organ becomes more conspicuous,
simply on account of the degeneration of the cells; this is
the condition usually present in the liver of aged persons.
More often, however, the connective tissue receives some
kind of stimulation, which, although it does not amount to
inflammation, brings about an active growth and resulting
sclerosis. According to the particular case, the hardening
occurs in the form of isolated patches or strands, or affects
the whole periphery or even the depths of the organ, and
smothers the higher elements in its meshes, so producing
a further degeneration. The cellular elements disappear
gradually, connective tissue taking their place, and the
change may be so profound, that as in the case of the prostate
gland, the altered organ may actually transcend the
normal size, partial or general atrophy, however, being more
often the result.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>Sclerosis in old people sometimes takes the form of a
hardening of the liver (cirrhosis of the liver) or of the kidneys
(renal cirrhosis), but it is the arteries which are most commonly
affected by it, producing a symptom of degeneration
which is called arterial sclerosis.</p>

<p class='c007'>Cazalis long ago originated the oft-repeated aphorism:
“A man is as old as his arteries,” these vessels, by means
of which the blood is distributed throughout the whole
system, being of immense importance in the economy of
the organism. When the connective tissue is so freely
developed as to cause a hardening of the arteries, these are
hampered in the exercise of their function and become very
brittle. According to Demange, all the special modifications
undergone by the body during the period of old age
may be attributed to this atrophy of the arteries, but this
theory is proved to be an exaggeration by the fact that
post mortems on the aged frequently reveal the presence of
little or no arterial sclerosis.</p>

<p class='c007'>It might fairly be supposed that the hardening seen in
many organs of the body during the period of old age is
universal, and lends greater strength to the frame. The
bones, which are separated from one another in youth,
become welded together in old age owing to the calcareous
deposits in the joints, and the ossification of the joints
between the vertebra frequently causes the backbone to
assume the appearance of a continuous bone, the greater
part of the cartilage having become ossified. In spite of
this, and as though for the purpose of proving how physically
full of contradictions is the period of old age, the
human frame actually becomes lighter and the quantity of
component mineral substances becomes less. This brings
about a liability to fracture of the bones in old people.
The fracture of the neck of the femur is a constant cause of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_238'>238</span>death in the aged, as occurred for instance in the case of
Virchow, one of the most distinguished medical scientists
of the nineteenth century.</p>

<p class='c007'>Is science, it may be asked, in a position to state precisely
what are the principal modifications which occur in the
tissues of old people? At the International Congress of
Medicine held at Berlin in 1890, a well-known German
anatomist, Merkel,<a id='r295'></a><a href='#f295' class='c014'><sup>[295]</sup></a> attempted to reply to this question.
Speaking of the tissues of old people, he tried to show that
certain of these, such as the skin and the mucous membrane
(the epithelial tissues), preserve their youthful characters
to the end, whereas others, such as the connective
tissues, display profound changes. This essay was the
first attempt to form a picture of the details of senile
degeneration, but it did not reach any simple, general conclusion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Later on, I myself<a id='r296'></a><a href='#f296' class='c014'><sup>[296]</sup></a> tried to complete the work, and
for the purpose made use of the published results of all the
investigators who had studied senile degeneration. I gave
a summary of my conclusions in the following words:
“In senile atrophy the same condition is always present:
<em>the atrophy of the higher and specific cells of a tissue and their
replacement by hypertrophied connective tissue</em>.” In the
brain, the nerve cells disappear; that is to say, the cells
which subserve the higher functions such as intellectuality,
sensation, control of movement, and these are replaced by
elements of a lower kind, in especial by neuroglœa, a kind
of connective tissue of the brain. In the liver, the hepatic
cells, of great importance to the nutrition of the organism,
yield to connective tissue. In the kidneys, that tissue
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>invades and blocks the tubes by which the necessary process
of eliminating soluble waste matter is accomplished. In the
ovaries, the ova, the specific elements which serve to propagate
the race, are similarly eliminated and replaced by
granular cells, a variety of connective tissue. In other
words, a conflict takes place in old age between the higher
elements and the simpler or primitive elements of the
organism, and the conflict ends in the victory of the latter.
This victory is signalised by a weakening of the intellect,
by digestive troubles, and by lack of sufficient oxygen
in the blood. The word conflict is not used metaphorically
in this case. It is a veritable battle that rages in the
innermost recesses of our beings. Distributed throughout
every part of our bodies are certain cells which fulfil special
functions of their own. They are capable of independent
movement, and also of devouring all sorts of solid matter,
a capacity which has gained them their name of phagocytes
or voracious cells. The function these phagocytes
fulfil is a very important one, for it is they that congregate
in vast numbers around microbes or other harmful intruders,
in order to devour them. Effusions of blood and other
elements, on penetrating to parts of the body where their
presence is disadvantageous, are absorbed by these phagocytes.
In cases of apoplexy, where blood is shed into a part
of the brain, setting up paralysis, the phagocytes cluster
round the clot and devour the blood corpuscles it has
encased. This absorption is a lengthy process, but by degrees,
as the pressure of the effusion of blood is removed from
the brain, and paralysis disappears, the health of the
organism may become completely restored, recovery in such
a case being due to the work of the phagocytes. After
childbirth, when the uterus presents the appearance of a
great open wound clotted with blood, it is again the phagocytes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>that clean it and re-establish the normal condition. It
is plain, therefore, that the part played by these cells is
beneficent.</p>

<p class='c007'>The phagocytes may be divided into small active phagocytes,
generally known as the microphags, and larger
phagocytes called macrophags, which are sometimes active
and sometimes still. The former, which are produced in
the marrow of the bones, circulate freely in the blood, and
occur as some of the white blood corpuscles, or leucocytes.
They are distinguishable by their oval shape which facilitates
their easy passage through the smaller blood-vessels, and
allows of their accumulating in great numbers in the exudations
that form around microbes. These exudations may
be formed extremely rapidly, and so may arrest infection
in the case of many diseases.</p>

<p class='c007'>The absorption of extravasations of blood and the healing
of wounds are the work of the macrophags. In a
general way, the microphags may be said to rid us of
microbes, and the macrophags to heal mechanical injuries,
such as hæmorrhages, wounds, and so forth. Macrophags
possess a single unlobulated nucleus, and occur as white
corpuscles in the blood, lymph, and exudations, or as the
fixed cells in connective tissues, the spleen, and the lymphatic
glands, &#38;c.</p>

</div>

<p class='c007'>The phagocytes are endowed with a sensitiveness of their
own, and by means of a sense of smell or taste are able to
recognise the nature of their surroundings. According to
the impression made upon this sense, they approach the
object which arouses it, exhibit indifference to it, or withdraw
from its vicinity. When, however, an infectious
microbe finds its way into the body, the microphags are
attracted by its excretions and swarm into the exudations
surrounding it. The macrophags play a very important
part in bringing about senile decay. The atrophy of the
kidneys in old persons is attributable to their agency (Fig. 14).
They accumulate in large quantities in these organs, clustering
round about the renal tubes which they ultimately
cause to disappear. Having appropriated the place of the
renal tubes, the macrophags proceed to form connective
tissue, which thus takes the place of the normal renal
tissue. A similar process occurs in the other organs that
degenerate in old age. In the brains of old persons and
animals, for instance, it is known that a number of nervous
cells are surrounded and devoured by macrophags (Fig. 15).
Judging from the investigations mentioned above, I think
I am justified in asserting that senile decay is mainly due
to the destruction of the higher elements of the organism
by macrophags. This conclusion has been confirmed by
means of direct observation, which was the more necessary
as it is contrary to the opinions of some biologists. Marinesco,<a id='r297'></a><a href='#f297' class='c014'><sup>[297]</sup></a>
an authority upon everything connected with the
nervous system, has disputed my theory, asserting that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>the destruction of the specific elements in the nervous
centres of old persons is not brought about through the
agency of macrophags. In support of his theory, M. Marinesco
was good enough to send me a series of preparations
from the spinal marrow of persons of very advanced years
from which evidence of destruction by means of phagocytes
or phagocytosis, was completely absent. I freely admit the
absence of phagocytosis in M. Marinesco’s preparations, but
these were derived from the cells of spinal marrow, which
is much less subject to the ravages of senile decay than is
the brain. Even in the lower portions of the encephalon,
senility and its parallel, phagocytosis, are uncommon,
whereas in the brains of old persons, which are more generally
affected by senile decay, the higher elements are clearly
shown to undergo destruction by macrophags (Fig. 15).
The same phenomenon may be observed in the case of
parrots and dogs of advanced age, and in other animals.</p>

<p class='c007'>So universal a symptom of old age is the invasion of the
tissues by macrophags, that it must be regarded as of immense
importance. In order, however, to determine more
precisely the nature of the function fulfilled by these phagocytes,
it was necessary to select a specially favourable subject
of investigation. My choice fell upon an examination
into the causes of the hair turning white,<a id='r298'></a><a href='#f298' class='c014'><sup>[298]</sup></a> that being as
a rule the first visible sign of approaching old age.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hair, before it has lost its colour, is full of pigment scattered
throughout the two layers of which each hair is
composed. At a given moment, the cells of the central
cylinder of a hair become active, and proceed to devour
all the pigment within their reach. Once they are filled
with coloured particles, these cells, which are a variety
of macrophag (generally called pigmentophags or more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>properly speaking chromophags), become migratory, and,
quitting the hair, either find their way under the skin or
leave the body (Fig. 16). The colouring-matter of the hair
is removed in this way
by chromophags, leaving
the hair colourless.</p>

<p class='c007'>The process by which
hair becomes white is of
importance, because it
shows that the activity
of macrophags is a dominant
factor in bringing
about senile decay. The
brittleness of old people’s
bones is probably due to
a similar cause, <em>i.e.</em>, to
the absorption and destruction
of the framework
brought about by
macrophags invading the
layers of bone. There is
still much that remains
unknown in this subject,
which is well worthy of
special research.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 16.</span> Hair about to become grey. Chromophags transporting the pigment granules.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The activity acquired
by macrophags during old age is closely connected with the
phenomena that are characteristic of certain chronic complaints.
Sclerosis in old persons belongs to the same category
as organic sclerosis, which may be set up by various
morbid influences. The analogy between senile decay of the
kidneys and chronic nephritis, commonly called interstitial
nephritis, is incontestable. The destruction of nervous cells
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>through the agency of macrophags, which we have already
mentioned as occurring in old age, is equally a symptom
of several diseases of the nervous centres, such as general
paralysis of the insane. Arterial sclerosis in old persons is
actually an inflammatory disease, similar to the inflammation
of the arteries set up by other maladies.</p>

<p class='c007'>The similarity between senility and disease has long been
recognised, and partly accounts for the repugnance we all
experience at the approach of old age. In childhood and
early youth people regard themselves as older than they
really are, and long to be “grown-up,” but having once
arrived at man’s estate, they do not wish to grow old. An
instinctive feeling tells us that there is something abnormal
in old age. It cannot be regarded as a part of healthy
physiological function. No doubt, because old age is the
inevitable lot of mankind, it may be termed normal, in the
same fashion as we call the pains of childbirth normal,
since few women escape them. In both cases, however,
we have to deal with pathological rather than physiological
conditions. Just as every effort is made to relieve the
sufferings of a woman in labour, so it is natural to try to
suppress the evils accompanying old age, but whereas in
childbirth an anæsthetic affords relief, old age is a chronic
malady, a remedy for which is much harder to find. We
have seen that in old age a struggle takes place between the
higher elements and the phagocytes, the end being usually
a weakening in vitality of the former, while the activity of the
latter is enormously increased. It would appear, arguing
from this, that one means of fighting against old age, pathologically
speaking, would be to strengthen the higher elements
of the organism, and to weaken the aggressive
capacities of the phagocytes. Let me at once warn the
reader that this is not presented as a definite, but as a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>possible solution of the problem, and is offered for consideration
like many other hypotheses on scientific questions.
The properties of cellular elements are easily changed when
subjected to various influences, and it is therefore not irrational
to seek some means of strengthening the blood corpuscles,
nerve cells, liver cells, muscular fibres of the heart,
and so forth. The task has become easier since the discovery
of serums that have specific actions on the tissues.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the third chapter I stated that serums were known
which give precipitates only with the blood of man and
of his near relatives the anthropoid apes.  Serum of
this kind has a definite specific action. Serums may be
prepared that dissolve only the red corpuscles of particular
species of animals, and that are without action on the other
organic elements. It has been found possible, even, to
prepare a serum that arrests instantaneously the movements
of human spermatozoa, and that is neutral to the
similar cells of other animals.</p>

<p class='c007'>These serums are all prepared in the same way. The
cellular elements in question, spermatozoa or red corpuscles,
cells of the liver or of the kidney, taken from one animal,
are injected into an animal of another species. After
several injections have been made, the serum of the animal
operated on becomes active with respect to the cells introduced
into its body. These serums were discovered by
J. Bordet of the Pasteur Institute, but the results have
been confirmed by investigators in other countries. The
serums are specifically <em>cytotoxic</em>, that is to say, they poison
particular kinds of cells.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now it has been shown that such serums, employed in
small doses, do not kill or dissolve the specific tissue elements,
but actually strengthen them.<a id='r299'></a><a href='#f299' class='c014'><sup>[299]</sup></a> Here the case is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>analogous with the action of poisons, such as digitalis, which
kill in strong doses, but which in weak doses improve or
strengthen the action of certain tissues. In accordance
with this indication, experiment has shown that small doses
of a serum which is capable of dissolving the red corpuscles
of human blood, actually increase the number of those in
the body of a patient treated by injections. In the same
way, in the case of a serum large doses of which destroy
the red corpuscles of a rabbit, small doses increase the
number of these elements in the blood.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here there seems to be a rational method by which we
may strive to strengthen the higher elements of the human
body, and so prevent them from growing old. The task,
at first sight indeed, seems an easy one, only necessitating
the injection of a horse (or other animal) with finely minced
atoms of human organs, such as brain, heart, liver, kidney,
&#38;c., when serums could be drawn off in the course of a
few weeks, capable of acting upon those organs. In reality
the process would be a very difficult one to carry out, as
human organs are rarely obtainable in a condition suitable
for injecting into animals. Post mortems can only be legally
made twenty-four hours after death, and there are many
other obstacles in the way of removing organs from dead
bodies. Even if all these difficulties were overcome, another
difficulty that would present itself would be the experimenting
with various doses of cytotoxic serums of various
strength. It is not therefore to be wondered at that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>attempt to reinforce the higher elements of the human
organism will require much time. If it be necessary to
strengthen the higher elements (nervous, hepatic, renal, and
cardiac cells), it is plain that they undergo a progressively
weakening process. It would be of the highest importance
to ascertain the cause of this, for the knowledge would be
a guide to future action.</p>

<p class='c007'>The similarity between senile decay and the diseases
entailing atrophy in the more important human organs
suggests a similitude in cause. Scleroses of the brain,
kidneys, and liver frequently originate in intoxication by
poisons such as alcohol, lead, mercury, and so forth, or the
disease may be induced by some virus, the virus of syphilis
being a common cause.</p>

<p class='c007'>The immense importance of venereal disease as a malevolent
factor in the phenomena of old age, is especially
manifested in arterial sclerosis. According to the careful
investigations of a Swedish doctor, Edgren,<a id='r300'></a><a href='#f300' class='c014'><sup>[300]</sup></a> published in
his “Monograph on Arterial Sclerosis,” one case in every
five of this disease is caused by syphilis, and he shows that
chronic alcoholism is an even more frequent cause (25 per
cent.). These two factors when united are responsible for
nearly half (45 per cent.) the cases of arterial sclerosis
that occur. Syphilitic virus and alcohol act as poisons
which bring about first degeneration and brittleness of the
arterial walls, and eventually a weakening of the higher
elements of the organism. The phagocytes, being cells of
an inferior order, are less sensitive to these poisons, which
accounts for their victory over the poisoned elements.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rheumatism, gout, and infectious diseases only play a
secondary part in setting up arterial sclerosis. Edgren
asserts, as the result of very careful calculation, that in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>nearly every fifth case he found it was impossible to account
for the origin of arterial sclerosis. In the majority of cases
the sufferers were elderly persons who, according to Edgren,
“were afflicted with physiological sclerosis.”<a id='r301'></a><a href='#f301' class='c014'><sup>[301]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>I take it that this sclerosis of unknown origin was by
no means physiological but was pathological like that
set up by syphilis or alcoholism. The question then arises
whence comes the poison in such cases? In syphilis there
is a virus of a definite nature to deal with, which causes
infection or poisoning, and brings about arterial sclerosis,
general paralysis, and other serious ailments. Alcoholism
is a poison arising from fermentation, excited by microscopical
fungi related to true microbes. Instances of
arterial sclerosis which are due neither to syphilis nor to
alcohol poisoning nor to any other known cause, can only
be accounted for as probably arising from poisoning set up
by the mass of microbes congregated in the human intestines.
Among these microbes there may be some that are
harmless, and possibly even beneficial, but there are undoubtedly
a great number the presence of which is extremely
prejudicial to health and life. It is impossible to enter into
the details of such an important question, and a brief
mention must suffice.</p>

<p class='c007'>The human intestine contains an enormous quantity of
bacteria, which, according to the recent investigations of
Strassburger,<a id='r302'></a><a href='#f302' class='c014'><sup>[302]</sup></a> increase at the rate of 128,000,000,000,000
each day. These microbes, of which there are few in the
digestive portion of the alimentary canal, are very numerous
in the large intestines, <em>i.e.</em>, in the lower part containing
the waste material. The remains of undigested foods and the
mucous secretions form a medium very favourable to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>growth of microbes. This bacterial flora constitutes a third
part of the human excreta. It is very varied, and contains
an immense number of different species, among which are
bacilli, cocci, and many kinds of other bacteria, about which
little is known. The distribution of this bacterial flora
shows that it contributes nothing to the well-being of man,
being scanty in the digestive portions of the body, and
abundant in other parts of the gut. This fact alone suffices
to refute the theory of those who attribute great functional
importance to the intestinal flora. This theory originated
principally from the fact that certain animals perish when
brought up under special conditions protecting them from
the presence of microbes. Schottelius<a id='r303'></a><a href='#f303' class='c014'><sup>[303]</sup></a> was the first to
try the experiment of rearing chickens in a cage specially
constructed for this purpose. The chickens hatched out,
and lived for a few weeks: then, there being no microbes
within them and only sterilised food being given, instead of
increasing in weight, they became thin and showed signs
of starvation. Schottelius supplied them with food from
which bacteria were no longer excluded, upon which the
chickens rallied, and soon became completely restored to
health. Madame Metchnikoff<a id='r304'></a><a href='#f304' class='c014'><sup>[304]</sup></a> tried a similar experiment
with tadpoles, which, when kept in vessels and fed upon
bread containing the usual microbes, developed normally,
but which, when reared under conditions entirely free from
the presence of microbes, lived on for some months, but in
a degenerate condition, their development being arrested.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the other hand, Nuttall and Thierfelder<a id='r305'></a><a href='#f305' class='c014'><sup>[305]</sup></a> succeeded
in keeping alive for several days new-born guinea-pigs, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>alimentary canals of which were free from microbes, and
which were fed only on absolutely sterilised milk and
vegetable matter. Notwithstanding this complete absence
of microbes the guinea-pigs developed well.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the two sets of experiments were conducted under
conditions arranged so carefully that the chance of error was
excluded, it is important to try to reconcile the apparently
contradictory results. There is one point common to these
three experiments, <em>i.e.</em>, that they were all executed upon
newly born creatures. Now it is well known that at birth
the digestive juices are often very imperfectly secreted. In
the case of the guinea-pigs, these juices sufficed in quantity
for the digestion of the diet provided, whereas in the cases
of the chickens and the tadpoles, the digestive juices were
incapable of fulfilling their function satisfactorily, and the
introduction of microbes endowed with considerable digestive
capacity into the intestines compensated for the
functional inefficiency of the gastric juices. In addition to
the guinea-pigs experimented upon by Nuttall and Thierfelder,
there may be mentioned a whole series of lower
creatures such as the larvæ of mites and other insects
which are able to digest such indigestible material as wax
and wool in spite of the total absence of microbes within
their intestinal tubes. These experiments are corroborated
by the established physiological fact that the gastric and
pancreatic juices of mammals easily digest the most varied
kinds of foods, even if treated so antiseptically as to ensure
the total exclusion of microbes from the intestines.</p>

<p class='c007'>I need not go further into this subject as the facts which
I have cited suffice for my present purpose. The complete
atrophy of the large intestines in the case of the woman
referred to in chap. iv. proves not only that this portion
of the alimentary canal is not indispensable to healthy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>life, but that life may be maintained in the absence of the
flora of the large intestines. And this really is the centre
of the problem. The useless bacterial flora may give rise
to serious or fatal maladies. Wounds of the abdomen are
really serious only when they penetrate the large intestines
and so allow the entrance of bacteria from that region to
the peritoneal cavity. In such an event, the microbes
rapidly multiply in the organism and produce a grave and
frequently mortal illness. So long as the microbes remain
within the intestines very few of them get into the circulation,
and with these few the organism is able to cope.
While most of the microbes are confined within the walls
of the alimentary canal, the soluble excretions produced
by them pass through into the lymph and blood. Quite
a number of different facts establish this. Thus, for instance,
it has been known for long that the urine of human beings
and of animals contains a series of substances such as
derivatives of phenol, indol, creosol, skatol, and so forth.
In certain diseases the amount of these substances greatly
increases. The stagnation of the contents of the intestines
increases the amount of phenol and indol. Such facts and
many others make it probable that these substances are
the products of the bacterial flora of the intestines. They are
absorbed by the intestinal wall, pass into the general circulation,
and may give rise to various symptoms of a more
or less serious nature.</p>

<p class='c007'>Baumann, who has done much work on the subject, has
brought together a series of arguments supporting the
bacterial origin of the presence in the urine of the substances
in question. Ewald, working from another point of view
has obtained strong confirmation of Baumann’s suggestions.
He had the opportunity of making observations on a female
patient, in whom, on account of a strangulated hernia, an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>intestinal fistula was established. Throughout the time
during which the large intestines were inactive, the urine
contained neither phenol nor indol. But as soon as the
fistula was closed and communication with the large intestine
had been re-established, phenol and indol reappeared in the
excreta. Ewald formed the opinion, therefore, that these
substances were products of the large intestine.</p>

<p class='c007'>I need not weary the reader with more of the facts serving
to show that the bacterial flora of the large intestines is
the source of many poisons harmful to the body. It is
among such substances that we must look for the slow
poisons which, in the absence of syphilis or alcoholism,
produce the arterial sclerosis of old age.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the fourth chapter I gave reasons to support my view
that the large intestine in mammals had been developed
because, by storing the products of digestion, it allowed
them to run long distances without stopping, and so was
an advantage in the struggle for existence. Moreover, the
microbes which abound in the contents of the gut make
it possible to use certain substances such as cellulose,
that are difficult to digest. But these two advantages do
not count in the case of the human race. Man does not
secure his prey or escape from his enemies by the rapidity
of his locomotion. The great development of his intellectual
powers has given him advantages of another kind.
Moreover, by the use of cooking and the cultivation of
plants of high nutritive value, he is able to dispense with
the digestion of cellulose.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is another side to the picture. Ignorant of death
and of old age, mammals have acquired the advantages of
a large intestine at the expense of longevity. I have already
stated that birds live longer than mammals. Birds are
practically devoid of a large intestine, and maintain a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>bacterial flora very much poorer than that found in mammals.
There is one exception to this rule, an exception of great
importance. Ostriches and their allies, the largest known
birds, are characterised by absence of the power of flight and
by rapidity of terrestrial locomotion by which they escape
their enemies. These are the only birds in which the large
intestine is well-developed. The duration of life is much
less in their case than in that of smaller birds, such as
parrots, ravens, and swans. According to M. Rivière, who
has been engaged in ostrich farming in Algeria, these large
birds do not live more than thirty-five years. The mode
of life, and the shorter duration of life, the huge development
of the large intestines and the rich bacterial flora found
therein make the ostriches much more like mammals
than birds.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is to be noticed that many birds in which the duration
of life is long do not possess a cæcum, the portion of the
alimentary canal that contains most bacteria. Examination
of the intestinal contents of parrots shows that there
exist in these birds very few microbes. A comparative
study shows plainly that the existence of an abundant
intestinal flora, useless for digestion, helps to shorten life
by producing bacterial poisons which weaken the higher
elements and strengthen the phagocytes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The human race has inherited from its ancestors an enormous
large intestine and conditions favourable to the life
of bacteria. It has to endure the disadvantages of this
heritage. On the other hand, the brain of man is very
highly developed, and with the increase of intellectual
power has come a consciousness of old age and death. Our
strong will to live is opposed to the infirmities of age and
the shortness of life. Here lies the greatest disharmony of
the constitution of man.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>If we desired to make the phenomena of old age physiological
rather than pathological, it would be necessary to
reduce the evils arising from the presence of a large intestine.
It is impossible, I may at once say, to wait for the operation
of forces independent of the human will and that might lead
to the suppression of an organ which has become useless.
Man, guided by exact science, must strive to accelerate or
anticipate such a result. In spite of the progress of surgery,
I do not expect to find in our time that the large intestine
will be removed by operation. Perhaps in the distant
future such a proceeding will become normal. For the
present it is more reasonable to attack the harmful microbes
of the large intestine. In the varied flora of that region
there exist microbes termed anærobic, because they are
able to live in the absence of free oxygen, obtaining what
they require by the decomposition of organic matter. Such
decomposition is attended by fermentations and putrefactions,
and the production of poisons, such as the alkaloids
(ptomaines), fatty acids, and even true toxins.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the human intestines under normal conditions, putrefaction
occurs only very slightly, or does not occur at all.
But in intestinal diseases of children and of adults, the
microbes of putrefaction multiply abundantly and produce
copious secretions which inflame the intestinal walls. To
avoid these diseases of putrefaction in the case of infants,
it has been suggested to use as food only sterilised milk or
other foods quite free from microbes. This regimen has
proved extremely successful.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the investigation of the factors that hinder putrefaction,
it has been noticed that milk putrefies with considerable
difficulty, whereas meat, preserved under the same conditions,
decomposes very readily. Investigators have attributed
the stability of milk to the presence of casein or of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>milk-sugar. However, investigations recently made by
Bienstock<a id='r306'></a><a href='#f306' class='c014'><sup>[306]</sup></a> and confirmed by Tissier and Martel<a id='r307'></a><a href='#f307' class='c014'><sup>[307]</sup></a> have
proved the existence of certain microbes that hinder the
putrefaction of milk. These are in particular the microbes
that sour milk, <em>i.e.</em>, cause the formation of lactic acid, and
which are antagonistic to the microbes of putrefaction. The
latter multiply only in an alkaline medium. The lactic acid
microbes produce large quantities of acid and so hinder the
multiplication of the organisms of putrefaction. Putrefaction
takes place rapidly, in spite of the presence of the lactic
acid microbes, if there be added soda to macerations of
meat or milk. Such facts explain how it is that lactic acid
frequently stops some cases of diarrhœa, and why treatment
with lactic acid is so useful in maladies associated with
putrefaction of the intestinal contents. It makes intelligible,
moreover, the medicinal value of fermented milk.</p>

<p class='c007'>Rovighi,<a id='r308'></a><a href='#f308' class='c014'><sup>[308]</sup></a> an Italian physician, drank daily a litre and
a half of kephir, a preparation made by subjecting milk to
lactic acid and alcoholic fermentations. He found that in
a few days the products of intestinal putrefaction in his
urine either disappeared or were greatly reduced.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is plain, then, that the slow intoxications that weaken
the resistance of the higher elements of the body and that
strengthen the phagocytes may be arrested by the use of
kephir, or still better of soured milk. The latter differs
from kephir in that it contains no alcohol, and alcohol in
course of time diminishes the vitality of some important
cells in the body. The presence of a number of the lactic
acid bacteria is inimical to the growth of the bacteria of
putrefaction, and so is of great service to the organism.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>But it is not enough merely to introduce useful microbes
into the body. We must also prevent the entrance of
“wild” microbes, many of which are harmful. Soil, especially
when it has been manured, contains large numbers
of microbes, some of which are harmful. Bienstock found
that the soil of the strawberry-beds in his garden contained
the bacilli of tetanus. For three weeks he swallowed some
of this soil, but found that the bacteria were destroyed in
his intestines, which he attributed to the action of the normal
bacterial inhabitants of the alimentary canal. It is probable
that if this arresting action were weakened the body
would be infected by tetanus from spores of the tetanus
microbe swallowed with earth or strawberries or green
vegetables. Moreover, besides the organisms of tetanus,
there are many other dangerous anærobic bacteria in
manured garden soil.</p>

<p class='c007'>Obviously we should eat no raw food, but confine our
diet rigidly to food that has been thoroughly cooked or
sterilised. The exclusion of “wild” microbes and the
introduction of beneficial microbes, such as those of lactic
acid fermentation, must be of great service to health. I
know of individuals who have derived great benefit from
such a regimen.</p>

<p class='c007'>Science, even in its present imperfect condition, has many
weapons by which to prevent or at least diminish the slow
and chronic poisoning of the organism that leads eventually
to the degeneration of the higher elements. When these
elements are being destroyed by syphilis or alcoholism the
struggle must be directed against these evils. It is long
since we have known how to do this; that success has not
been greater is due to the carelessness of the people who
are concerned.</p>

<p class='c007'>To strengthen the resistance of the higher elements and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>to transform the “wild” population of the intestine into
a cultured population, these are the means by which the
pathological symptoms may be removed from old age, and
by which, in all probability, the duration of the life of man
may be considerably increased.</p>

<p class='c007'>If it be found impossible to eliminate all the harmful
microbes from the flora of the intestines, those that are
refractory may be rendered harmless by appropriate serums.
We know already a serum that is specific against the microbe
of botulism, an organism capable of exciting serious disturbance
if it gain entrance to the alimentary canal.</p>

<p class='c007'>Our inmost convictions assure us that life is too short,
and since the remotest ages attempts have been made to
prolong it. I need hardly mention the quest of the Middle
Ages for an elixir of life, but many thoughtful men have
occupied themselves with the problem.</p>

<p class='c007'>Descartes, who was deeply interested in the subject,
believed himself to have found a mode of lengthening
human life. Bacon published a tract on life and death,
and in it gave advice as to how old age might be reached;
blood-letting and the use of saltpetre were parts of his
specific.</p>

<p class='c007'>One of the oldest methods in the world consisted in
bringing old men in contact with the bodies of young girls.
David, King of Israel, employed this method, which at a
much later period came into fashion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Eighteenth-century quacks proclaimed a number of
specifics, among which was the “holy water” of Saint
Germain, an infusion of senna, merely purgative in its
effects. It is certain that some of the medicines used for
the purpose, by emptying the large intestine, decreased the
bacterial flora, and so checked the formation of the poisons
that are harmful to the higher elements.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>Hufeland,<a id='r309'></a><a href='#f309' class='c014'><sup>[309]</sup></a> a well-known German professor, published
towards the end of the eighteenth century, a work called “La
Macrobiotique”; or, “the Art of Prolonging Human Life.”
This treatise had a great vogue in its day, and contained
many interesting and just observations. Besides advocating
cleanliness and moderation, Hufeland advised that “we
should use vegetable rather than animal food, as animal
food was more liable to putrefaction, whilst vegetable substances
contained an acid principle that retarded our mortal
enemy, putrefaction.”<a id='r310'></a><a href='#f310' class='c014'><sup>[310]</sup></a> Here the physician of a day long
past anticipated one of the discoveries of modern science.</p>

<p class='c007'>In our time scientific men have not ceased to concern
themselves with the prolongation of human life. Professor
Pflüger, of Bonn, one of the most distinguished of living
physiologists, has published an essay<a id='r311'></a><a href='#f311' class='c014'><sup>[311]</sup></a> in which he gave
the results of his inquiries into this subject. He first stated
that investigations into the habits of those who had attained
a great age did not give information sufficiently exact.
Pflüger laid stress on the means of avoiding infectious
maladies, and summed up as follows: “Finally, I can do
no better than to associate myself with the advice given
in all the treatises on the prolonging of life: avoid the
things that are harmful and be moderate in all things.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A year later, a well-known German physician, Dr. Ebstein<a id='r312'></a><a href='#f312' class='c014'><sup>[312]</sup></a>
published a very careful treatise on the same subject. He
had been struck by the fact that among those who have
reached a great age, there have been several who had led
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>an exuberant life, full of excesses, notably in the consumption
of alcohol. None the less, Ebstein advised either a
complete avoidance of alcoholic liquor, or at the most an
extreme temperance in the use of it. He prescribed in
addition the simplification of the conduct of life and the
avoiding of anything that is unwholesome.</p>

<p class='c007'>Study of such works, which are written in a scientific
spirit, convinces me that a science of the prolongation of
life could be built up. An exact investigation of the phenomena
of old age would contribute to this object. At any
rate, we cannot set aside as chimerical plans to make old age
a natural process, and one easy to bear. I believe, moreover,
that attempts to prolong life deserve to be encouraged, the
more so as instances of longevity are already numerous.</p>

<p class='c007'>Quite a number of cases of centenarians who have preserved
intellect and vigour until death have been recorded.
It is unnecessary to relate the histories of these persons,
of whom some attained such ages as 120, 140, and even
185 years (Saint Mungo of Glasgow). My friend, Professor
Ray Lankester,<a id='r313'></a><a href='#f313' class='c014'><sup>[313]</sup></a> thinks that such unusually old persons
are monstrosities comparable with those who have attained
a gigantic stature. But centenarians are more numerous
than giants, and while the latter exhibit marked signs of
pathological weakness the former surprise us by their health
and vigour.</p>

<p class='c007'>The longevity of the Israelites recorded in the Old Testament
is well known. No doubt there is much exaggeration
in these naïve records. Was it an error of exaggeration to
impute an age of 969 years to Methusaleh, or of 595 to
Noah, or were these ages reckoned on a different basis?
Henseler<a id='r314'></a><a href='#f314' class='c014'><sup>[314]</sup></a> suggested that in these cases each season was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>counted as a year, so that the age of Methusaleh was really
only 242 years, a length of life not so vastly greater than
ages recorded in modern times.</p>

<p class='c007'>There is evidence to show that in somewhat later Biblical
times ages were reckoned in our years. Thus in the Book
of Numbers (i. 3, 20, 22) reference is made to those “From
twenty years old and upward, all that are able to go forth
to war in Israel.” The limit of age given shows clearly
that the years counted were our years. This interpretation
is supported by many other passages in the Pentateuch,
notably where annual harvest feasts are spoken of. We
may therefore accept as probable the assignment of such
ages as 100 or 120 years to several Biblical personages, such
as Aaron, Moses, and Joshua. And the words put in the
mouth of Jahveh may be accepted as important evidence:
“And the Lord said, My spirit shall not always strive with
man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred
and twenty years.”<a id='r315'></a><a href='#f315' class='c014'><sup>[315]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The longevity of that remote period must have surpassed
the age of the present time. From the circumstance that
the greatest number of deaths occurs at the age of seventy
years, Ebstein<a id='r316'></a><a href='#f316' class='c014'><sup>[316]</sup></a> has inferred that seventy years is the
normal duration of life. Although there is no doubt but
that the duration of human life has become longer in the
nineteenth century, we must believe that it was still longer
in Biblical times, a fact that is not particularly surprising.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have called attention to the important influence of
syphilis in inducing premature and pathological old age,
as that disease is a chief cause of arterial sclerosis and
degeneration of the higher elements of the body. Syphilis
has an influence still more serious because its effects are
inherited. Now although the Bible refers to diseases of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>the genital organs and lays stress on circumcision, there is
no direct evidence in it as to the existence of syphilis.
Ebstein, in a treatise on the medicine of the Bible,<a id='r317'></a><a href='#f317' class='c014'><sup>[317]</sup></a> is
confident that there is no reference to syphilis in that Book.
Moreover, in the ancient world generally, syphilis was either
unknown or existed only in an attenuated form. Haeser,<a id='r318'></a><a href='#f318' class='c014'><sup>[318]</sup></a>
the author of the best modern treatise on the history of
medicine, thinks that if syphilis did exist in the ancient
world, it occurred in a localised form and did not become
a general disease of the system as is the case among the
moderns.</p>

<p class='c007'>Humanity would make a great stride towards longevity
could it put an end to syphilis, which is the cause of one fifth
of the cases of arterial sclerosis. The suppression of
alcoholism, the second great factor in the production of
senile degeneration of the arteries, will produce a still more
marked extension of the term of life. Scientific study of
old age and of the means of modifying its pathological
character will make life longer and happier. Although
modern knowledge is still imperfect, there is no reason to
be pessimistic on the subject of old age.</p>

<p class='c006'>From what I have said in the last chapter, it is plain that,
perhaps before very long, it will be possible to modify old
age. Instead of retaining its existing melancholy and
repulsive character, it may become a healthy and endurable
process; it may also be that the duration of life will be
prolonged. However, it may be asked, what shall we
gain by attaining the age of 100 or 120 years instead of
70 or 80, if there still remain for us the appalling fate of
the inevitable annihilation of death. Marcus Aurelius said
that he who makes a long journey and he who makes
it short, alike meet death at the end; and that once
they are over, three years or a century are much alike.
Such assertions, however, do not take into account the
difference in the values we set on a thing at different ages.
A man of the age of twenty-five years and one fifty years old
reason differently, and are affected differently by the same
surroundings. The outlook on life changes in the same
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>individual as he gets on in years. Young people judge of
their impressions by comparison with their ideals, and as
the latter are very high, they are dissatisfied with things
as they really are. They are exacting, and discontented
with what they can get out of the real world; grown up
people and those of advanced years are more easily satisfied
because they have a clearer knowledge of the true value
of things. As I have already had occasion to point out
in a previous chapter, the young are more inclined to
pessimism than the old. We see, then, that appreciation
of life changes with age. It is the same with regard to
death. It has often been said that life is only a preparation
for death. Cicero said, “From our youth upwards
we must accustom ourselves to face our last moments
without fear. If not, there is an end to peace, since it is
quite certain that we must die.” Philosophy has been
called the art of preparing for death.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before considering in what direction science may direct
our steps towards solving the problem of death, which in
the words of St. Paul is the “last enemy to be destroyed,”
let us see how much is known about it.</p>

<p class='c007'>We are so accustomed to look upon death as something
natural and inevitable, that it has long since come to
be regarded as inherent in organisms. However, when
biologists investigated the matter more carefully, they
failed to discover any proof of the accepted doctrine.
Observation of members of the lowest grade of animal life,
such as infusorians and other protozoa, has shown that
these reproduce by simple division, and in a very short
time multiply to an astonishing extent. Generation
succeeds generation, with the utmost rapidity and without
the intervention of death; no single corpse appears in
the swarming masses of animalculæ. From such facts,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>which are extremely easy to confirm, several biologists,
and in specially Bütschli and Weismann,<a id='r319'></a><a href='#f319' class='c014'><sup>[319]</sup></a> have deduced
an immortality of the unicellular organisms. When an
infusorian has divided, each daughter organism rapidly
completes itself and sets about again dividing in the
fashion of its parent. The process may be more complicated,
as in the cases where a single organism breaks up
into several portions each of which contains an essential
part of the parent organism. Many unicellular organisms
reproduce in such a fashion, and as each animal divides
simultaneously into a number of individuals of the new
generation, the individuality is destroyed. It is possible
to admit with Götte<a id='r320'></a><a href='#f320' class='c014'><sup>[320]</sup></a> that such a process is natural death,
although there is no actual destruction and no corpse.</p>

<p class='c007'>In any event it cannot be disputed that lower organisms
are not subject to the natural death that comes inevitably
to man and the higher animals. It has been suggested
that the debility of infusorians after a rapid series of
divisions, and before conjugation, is to be interpreted as
natural death. But the rejuvenescence that follows conjugation
is incompatible with such an interpretation.
Moreover, when conjugation does not occur, and the debility
leads to death, the deaths must be regarded as accidental.</p>

<p class='c007'>The theory of the immortality of unicellular organisms
is now generally accepted. However, there are animals,
higher in the scale of life, to which natural death does not
come. Among these occur certain forms of considerable
complexity, composed of many organs and very many
cells, such as many polyps, and some worms, especially
annelid worms. Some annelids (Fig. 17) reproduce by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>transverse divisions very actively. “Throughout the
summer,” said E. Perrier,<a id='r321'></a><a href='#f321' class='c014'><sup>[321]</sup></a> “the Naïdimorpha are devoid
of genital organs, and apparently
(according to unpublished
observations of Maupas), they
may be kept alive for several
years, and perhaps indefinitely,
in this sexless condition.” This
certainly may be regarded as a
case of immortality due to the
indefinite power of regeneration
possessed by a complex animal.</p>

<p class='c007'>The facts that I have cited
show that death is not necessarily
inherent in living organisms.
Naegeli,<a id='r322'></a><a href='#f322' class='c014'><sup>[322]</sup></a> a well-known German
botanist, has asserted even that
natural death does not exist in
nature. He points out that trees,
more than a thousand years old,
perish not by natural death, that
is to say, by the gradual decay
of their vitality, but by some
catastrophe.</p>

<p class='c007'>The age of the famous dragontree

<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>It was only by a catastrophe that the long-lived giant
perished. The Baobab is reputed to live for five or six
thousand years.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a recently published essay, Jacques Loeb,<a id='r323'></a><a href='#f323' class='c014'><sup>[323]</sup></a> a distinguished
biologist in Chicago, has made a study of
natural death, and has come to the conclusion that there
is no good evidence for its existence. He has observed
that ripe, but unfertilised eggs of sea hedgehogs (Echini)
die a few hours after they have been discharged. Loeb
thinks that this may be a case of natural death, but I
cannot agree with this opinion, as an egg that has not
been fertilised by a spermatozoon may be compared with
an organism deprived of its nutrition and so dying of
starvation. In both cases death is purely accidental and
could have been avoided.</p>

<p class='c007'>If natural death does exist, it must have appeared on
the face of the earth long after the appearance of life.
Weismann has suggested that death arose as an adaptation
for the advantage of the species, that is to say, in relation
to the surrounding conditions of existence, and not as an
absolute necessity inherent in the nature of the living
substance. He thought that as worn organisms are no
longer suited for reproduction or for the struggle for life,
natural death was due to natural selection, it being necessary
to maintain the species in a vigorous state by weeding out
the debased individuals. But the introduction of death
for that purpose was superfluous, since the debility caused
by old age in itself would eliminate the aged in the course
of the struggle for existence. Violent death must have
appeared almost as soon as living things came into being.
The infusorians and other low organisms, despite their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>potential immortality, must have been subjected perpetually
to violent death, falling victims to larger and stronger
organisms. It is impossible to regard natural death, if
indeed it actually exists, as the product of natural selection
for the benefit of the species. In the press of the world
natural death rarely could come into operation, because
maladies or the voracity of enemies so frequently cause
violent death.</p>

<p class='c007'>No doubt a certain number of deaths are recorded in
statistics as being due to old age, without visible malady.
Sometimes decrepit old men feel no pain and seem to fall
quietly into their eternal sleep; but autopsy reveals serious
lesions of the internal organs. There is reason to believe
that even such deaths are in reality violent and are usually
caused by infectious microbes. The general effect on the
mind produced by examination of the collected facts is
not an acceptance of the view that natural death is
essentially inherent in living organisms, but the production
of a wish to discover if there be any real proof of its
existence.</p>

<p class='c007'>For some time natural death has been ascribed only to
the parts of the body that are of use in the individual life.
Those cells, the function of which is to secure reproduction
of the species, are, like unicellular organisms, potentially
immortal. The egg-cell of the female is transformed into
a fœtus, and so is the starting-point of the new generation,
while the sexual cells of the new generation give rise to the
third generation, and so on, in an endless chain of life. The
greater number, by far, of the eggs and spermatozoa perish;
but their death is not natural but violent, being due to
harmful external agencies. An infinitesimal minority of the
sexual cells survive indefinitely in the successions of generations.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>Scientific proof exists, therefore, that our bodies contain
immortal elements, eggs or spermatozoa. As these
cells not only are truly alive but exhibit properties that
are within the category of psychical phenomena, it would
be possible to build up a serious thesis on the immortality
of the soul.</p>

<p class='c007'>Observations on protozoa, and especially on the infusorian
group of protozoa, show that these simple beings,
each of which is composed of no more than a single cell, possess
a high degree of sensibility. They select their food,
distinguish living from dead animalculæ,<a id='r324'></a><a href='#f324' class='c014'><sup>[324]</sup></a> seek out their
mates for conjugation, avoid danger, and hunt their prey;
in fact, they are in possession of a set of qualities that must
be included in psychical phenomena. Although such
phenomena are very much lower in the case of the infusorians
than in the case of higher animals, it is possible
to speak of the soul of protozoa. Moreover, as the body
is immortal by reason of its indefinite power of reproduction
by division, the soul also of these creatures is immortal.
However, the soul is so primitive that it is impossible to
speak in definite terms about it.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the sexual cells of the human body are immortal,
like the protozoa, the problem arises if these too be
endowed with an immortal soul. Our existing knowledge
makes it impossible to doubt that ova and spermatozoa
have sensibility in a degree as high as that of the protozoa.
The ova shed secretions that arouse the sensibility of the
spermatozoa, and the latter, directed by this specific
“odour” (the occurrence being known technically as
chemotaxis), make their way to the ovum and penetrate it.
Some substances, arousing the spermatozoa into activity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>and movement, attract them, others repel them. The
phenomena of chemotaxis were shown for the first time
in the case of cryptogams by Pfeffer, the distinguished
botanist, and since then the male cells of many plants and
different kinds of animals have been proved to possess
sensibility.</p>

<p class='c007'>When ova and spermatozoa succeed in conjugating, they
produce an individual of the next generation, to which
they transmit what Haeckel has called the “cellular soul.”<a id='r325'></a><a href='#f325' class='c014'><sup>[325]</sup></a>
This soul, then, is really immortal, inasmuch as the bodies
of the reproductive cells are immortal.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although it is true that our bodies contain elements
endowed with immortal souls, it by no means follows
that our conscious souls are immortal. In an earlier
chapter, I have already pointed out that the psychical
phenomena of many of the cells of our body and the cellular
souls of these are outside our consciousness. We have no
consciousness of the perpetual battle waged by the phagocytes
against the microbes that endeavour to obtain a
foothold in our tissues. None the less the phagocytes are
elements endowed with mobility and sensibility and possessing
a cellular soul like that of the protozoa.</p>

<p class='c007'>A woman has no consciousness of the numerous spermatozoa,
with their cellular souls, that enter her body, nor
of those that fertilise her egg-cells; she is even without
consciousness of the much more highly developed soul of
the fœtus. A child before birth possesses psychical qualities
much more numerous and more perfect than those of the
reproductive cells. It is capable of responding to certain
sensations and of performing movements. A child, in the
later months of its prenatal existence, possesses the senses
of touch and taste and, within limits, the sense of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>sight.<a id='r326'></a><a href='#f326' class='c014'><sup>[326]</sup></a> This soul is outside the consciousness of the mother.
The mother cannot even tell by her consciousness if she bears
under her girdle one or two embryonic souls. And so
the immortality of the cellular soul has no relation to the
problem of death.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is a common opinion that only the reproductive cells
of man and animals are immortal, and that the other
elements of the body are mortal, the latter, if they escape
violence, dying a natural death. A contrast has been
drawn between the mortal cells in which is resident the
life of the body and the immortal cells on which the species
depends. However, when non-reproductive cells possess
the power of regeneration, it is impossible to deny their
immortality. When a polyp or a worm reproduces by
division, a large number of cells go to form the new individual,
and these cells are immortal in the fashion of the infusoria.</p>

<p class='c007'>Immortal animals occur only among the lower invertebrates.
The power of regeneration fades away in the higher
ranks of the scale of life. Whilst worms may be divided
in several pieces, each piece being capable of regeneration
so as to form a new worm, when molluscs are cut they
display only a limited capacity for regeneration. If the
antennæ of a snail be amputated they will be renewed,
but if the whole creature be cut in pieces death follows.
Some of the lower vertebrates, such as newts and salamanders,
can renew the tail and the limbs, but they cannot
reproduce by division. Birds and mammals, the higher
vertebrates, have very little power of regeneration, and
tail and limbs are never reformed in their cases.</p>

<p class='c007'>It seems to be the case that the advance in the general
organisation of animals has involved a loss in the reproductive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>capacity of the cells and tissues. Even in the
highest animals, some organs, such as the liver, still
possess regenerative capacity; but, on the other hand,
many cells have lost the power of regeneration completely.
The nervous cells, in particular, which are the highest and
most perfectly organised elements of the body, cannot
reproduce themselves.
After their
initial appearance
in the course of
embryonic development,
they pass their
lives without regenerating
or reproducing.
In acquiring
the highest qualities,
that is to say,
their psychical activity,
they have lost
completely the
power of reproduction,
the distinctive
feature of immortal cells. If cells doomed to natural
death really exist, it is in the nervous tissues that we must
look for them.</p>

<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 18.</span>—Ephemerids.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The existence of natural death in the animal world
cannot be denied, but it is very rare. The best example
is that of the curious insects known universally as
ephemerids (Fig. 18). Swarms of these delicate and
graceful insects are to be seen in the summer months round
lights. The perfect insects emerge from water, in which
the six-legged larvæ feed on the organic débris contained
in fresh water. The larvæ are not predaceous, and escape
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>from their numerous and hungry foes by agility. They
are long-lived, some of them passing two or three years in
the mud of streams, and in the end become winged insects
after a rapid metamorphosis. Near Paris, anglers have
a popular name (<em>manne</em>, manna) for one species (<em>Palingenia
virgo</em>) which emerges in swarms after sundown from the
waters of the Seine and Marne. The swarms fly in huge
numbers, like heavy snow-flakes, for a very short time,
and then fall into the water (Fig. 19). The flight of
these insects lasts only an hour or two, and then, in an
enfeebled condition, they fall down in vast numbers. They
are attracted by the lanterns lighted by fishermen, and
are collected to be used as bait. The life in the winged
condition is truly ephemeral and lasts no more than a
few hours. The structure of the insect is adapted to this
short life. The larvæ have powerful jaws, used in the
mastication of food; the winged insects possess only
vestiges of jaws. They are unable to feed, and so are
adapted only for the briefest existence. Their hour of
aerial life is devoted to love. As soon as they emerge
the males and females unite, and the packets of eggs, which
are deposited at once, fall into the water, and in a few
weeks the young larvæ hatch out.</p>

<p class='c007'>The mode of life and the organisation of the adult
ephemerids show plainly that they are adapted to natural
death. Death comes to them not because they are without
food, or because the environment fails to provide something
necessary to life, but merely because they emerge from
the larval state in a non-viable condition, without the
organs necessary to the maintenance of life.</p>

<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 19.</span>—Swarms of <em>Palingenia virgo</em>.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>Once it is granted that natural death actually exists,
it is necessary to study its mechanism as closely as the
existing state of knowledge permits. To exclude the
possibility of the death having to be interpreted as violent,
it would be necessary to know that some very rapid
infectious disease does not attack these insects as soon as
they emerge from the water. This possibility, although
remote, must be examined. Instances are known of large
numbers of insects dying very rapidly as the result of attack
by a species of mould which causes an epidemic. Every one
has seen, especially in autumn, dead flies anchored to the
window pane by a little tuft of white fluff. As so many
individuals die about the same time, we might be disposed
to assign the fact to natural death. The actual cause,
however, is an infectious and fatal disease caused by a parasitic
mould.</p>

<p class='c007'>The occurrence of some terrible epidemic may be
excluded from consideration in the case of ephemerids.
I have made investigations which show that such an
epidemic does not occur. The bodies of the dying ephemerids
contain no microbe which could be the cause of
death. Their death must be regarded as natural, as the
result of their organisation, as essentially a part of the
nature of the insects. Among the cells of their body there
are many active phagocytes. Is it possible to attribute
death to ravages that these cells may cause among the
higher cells and tissues? Microscopic examination, so
far from supporting such a possibility, shows that the
organs are quite normal in their intimate structure. The
brain and central nervous system, the muscles and other
organs, show no signs of that invasion by phagocytes found
in cases of senile degeneration. In this example of natural
death there is certainly no possibility of phagocytic intervention.</p>

<p class='c007'>Some biologists have suggested that the rapid death
of ephemerids and of some other insects is due to debility
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>caused by the great effort of depositing the male and female
sexual cells. On this supposition, the case would be
analogous to the shock which is sometimes the consequence
of a surgical operation. This hypothesis, however, may
be excluded, for among the dead ephemerids there are
many males that have not united with females. Among
ephemerids males are much more numerous than females;
many males have no opportunity of undergoing the sexual
shock and of emptying the reproductive organs, and these,
none the less, die as rapidly as the others.</p>

<p class='c007'>As yet we do not know if all the tissues of the ephemerids
die simultaneously in natural death. Most probably the
cells of the nervous centres perish first, and so bring death
on the others. The investigation ought to be made.</p>

<p class='c007'>Death comes to the ephemerids in the midst of love, at
the moment when their sexual instincts are satisfied. It
would be very interesting to know the sensations of these
creatures as they feel death come on them in the act of
reproduction. Naturally it would be impossible to obtain
a full answer to the question, but many interesting facts
regarding it may be ascertained. All the ephemerids, not
only those the life of which is so brief, but those that live for
several days (<em>Chloë</em>, for instance), are extremely easy to capture.
It is unnecessary to take them unawares or to use a
net as in the case of flies, wasps, and many other insects.
Ephemerids may be taken with the fingers in the simplest
way, because they offer no resistance and show no desire
to escape, although they have six legs and two or four wings.
This is not an isolated case, for some other insects (as, for
example, winged ants and aphides) allow themselves to be
captured with the same carelessness.</p>

<p class='c007'>Although the adult ephemerids are careless, the wingless
larvæ are timid. When a tube is brought near them, among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>the water plants, with the object of capturing them, they
rapidly move off. It often requires much patience and
quickness to capture these larvæ (Fig. 20). The instinct of
preservation of life displays itself by rapid flight.</p>

<div  class='figleft id003'>
<img src='images/fig_20.jpg' alt='' class='ig001'>
<div class='ic001'>
<p><span class='sc'>Fig. 20.</span>—Larva of an ephemerid (<em>Chloërufulum</em>).</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>It is remarkable that the adult insect has lost the instinct
of self-preservation. If it be touched it may move a short
distance off, but it does not take to flight
although its wings are very large, and its body,
which of itself weighs little, is still lighter
because the digestive tube is filled with air and
not with food. As a rule, an ephemerid that
has been touched does not even move off, but
allows itself to be captured without any resistance.
It would not be accurate to say that
the larva’s instinct of self-preservation has been replaced
in the adult by an instinct for death; but it must be
admitted that the instinct of preservation has been totally
lost. The lack of resistance cannot be explained by any
defect in the organs of sense. Not only are the eyes of the
larval stage fully preserved in the adult, but the adult males
have enormous eyes to enable them to recognise the female
in the turbulent flight which takes place at the close of the
day. Ephemerids of all ages possess well developed tactile
organs, and it is thus in spite of a highly organised sensory
system that the adults offer no resistance to enemies.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is no mere accident that the most striking examples
of natural death occur among insects, for these creatures
display an unusual stability in their cellular structure with a
corresponding lack of the power of regeneration, in these
particulars resembling man and the higher animals. The
cells of the nervous system are very complex, and are well
adapted for the highest function, that is to say, the psychical
function. These highly endowed cells, however, are devoid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>of the power of reproduction. Many experiments have been
made in relation to this, and it has been proved clearly that in
cold-blooded vertebrates the brain and spinal cord with the
nerve cells contained in them are capable of regeneration,
whilst among mammals only extremely rare cases are known
in which there has been any regeneration of the nervous
elements. It is to be expected, then, that cases of natural
death occur in the higher animals and especially in man.
However, no case is known so plain as that presented by
the ephemerids. I have already stated that of deaths
apparently due to senile debility in man, a large proportion
are certainly due to various infectious diseases that affect
the old, such as pneumonia and nephritis. Close examination
of the tissues confirms this conclusion, for the destruction
of the higher elements by phagocytes produces what is really
violent death and not a natural death like that of the
ephemerids.</p>

<p class='c007'>Natural death in man is probably a possibility rather than
an actual occurrence. Old age is not a true physiological
process but exhibits many morbid characters. That being
the case, it is not surprising that it seldom ends in natural
death. It is probable, however, that natural death occasionally
occurs in very old men.</p>

<p class='c007'>Attempts have been made to estimate the natural limits
of human life. Flourens<a id='r327'></a><a href='#f327' class='c014'><sup>[327]</sup></a> based a calculation on the
duration of the period of growth. If the latter be taken
as one fifth the natural life, then human life ought to last a
century. As centenarians are rare, the vast majority of
deaths, which happen before that age has been reached,
must be regarded as violent or accidental. The rule of
Flourens, however, is arbitrary, and there is no evidence
to show that it is exact. Probably in the human race, as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>in the case of ephemerids, the natural duration of life varies
and cannot be expressed by a definite figure. In most cases
it ought to be more than a hundred years, and only in rare
cases ought it to be much less than that term. Probably
there is a variation in the duration of life just as there is a
variation of the date of sexual maturity for which rules
may be laid down but not without anticipating numerous
exceptions.</p>

<p class='c007'>The existing pathological character of old age vitiates all
conclusions as to natural death, and it is still impossible to
be exact in speaking of that subject. It is known that
certain organs and tissues remain alive for some time after
death. In the case of certain infectious diseases, the heart
may be removed from a human body more than thirty hours
after death, and if placed under proper conditions will
renew its life, and beat for several hours. The white corpuscles,
the spermatozoa and the cilia of a corpse, may retain
their power of movement. Does this also happen in the rare
cases of natural death? That question must be answered
in the future. The most important question relating to
natural death is the following: Is the appearance of natural
death in man accompanied by the disappearance of one
instinct, the instinct of self preservation, and by the appearance
of another instinct, the instinct of death? Do the
phenomena of the ephemerids give us any indication as to
this? An exact answer is not to be expected. As old age
is generally what may be called an unnatural phenomenon,
it is extremely rare for persons to approach the age of
natural death with their faculties unclouded. I have had
under observation a centenarian old woman, who still remembered
some incidents of her youth; in her the desire
to live was still strong, but her intellectual faculties were
partially dim. Moreover, her brain, of which I have already
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>spoken (p. <a href='#Page_241'>241</a>), showed a marked degeneration of the nerve
cells due to the activity of macrophages.</p>

<p class='c007'>I have obtained much information about a centenarian
who was alive in Rouen in 1900, but a single glance at her
photograph was enough to show that she no longer was in full
possession of intelligence.<a id='r328'></a><a href='#f328' class='c014'><sup>[328]</sup></a> She was infirm in many ways.
So also, Chevreul, the celebrated chemist, who died at the
age of one hundred and three years, showed not the faintest
wish for death; he clung to life, but his mental powers had
grown weak.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cases to which I have referred are typical, but there
are exceptions worthy of close attention. Tokarski, in the
essay on the fear of death, to which I referred in the sixth
chapter, quoted the case of a female centenarian who stated
as follows: “If you come to live as long as I have lived,
you will understand not only that it is possible not to fear
death, but to feel the same need for death as for sleep.” A
new feeling had come into existence in the very old person,
a feeling incomprehensible to those less old. Apparently
this was a case in which the instinct of natural death had
appeared in a centenarian whose mental faculties had been
retained in a sufficiently perfect state.</p>

<p class='c007'>I wish very much that I had myself been a witness of this
old woman’s remarkable instinct in even one case of the
many that I have observed. But all that have been pointed
out to me as subject to this new desire have turned out to
have been possessed of very different ideas. Some were old
invalids, weary of pain and ready to exchange the sorrows
of life for death, but who would have preferred to be healed
and to live on in comfort. When the possibility of recovering
health was suggested to them, they showed signs of
pleasure and of the renewal of hope.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>Investigations that I have made in homes for the aged
have led to negative results on this subject. No case
showed the slightest sign of the approach of the instinct of
death. However, I have learned from Dr. Fauvel of one
case to add to the instance noticed by Tokarski. It was the
case of an old lady whose health and circumstances were
comfortable and who before her death showed a real desire
for it and stated it in much the same language as that quoted
by Tokarski. In Fauvel’s case, however, the old lady had
reached the age of only eighty-five years. It seems probable
that this was a second genuine case of the appearance of
the instinct of death, and it is therefore interesting to notice
that that instinct, like the sexual instinct, is subject to
variation in the date of its appearance.</p>

<p class='c007'>In my search for instances of the instinct of death, I made
use of the large collection made by Lejoncourt,<a id='r329'></a><a href='#f329' class='c014'><sup>[329]</sup></a> but found
that the information given by this author was very incomplete
as to the mode of life and the last moments of his cases.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Bible testifies to the frequency of old age in ancient
times and to the complete preservation of the faculties in
the aged. It also contains some references that may be
interpreted as instances of the instinct of death. I may take
its account of the death of some of the patriarchs. “And
these are the days of the years of Abraham’s life which he
lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years. Then
Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age,
an old man, and <em>full of years</em>.”<a id='r330'></a><a href='#f330' class='c014'><sup>[330]</sup></a> “And the days of Isaac
were an hundred and fourscore years. And Isaac gave
up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto his people,
being old and <em>full of days</em>: and his sons Esau and Jacob
buried him.”<a id='r331'></a><a href='#f331' class='c014'><sup>[331]</sup></a> “After this lived Job an hundred and forty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>years, and saw his sons, and his sons’ sons, even four
generations. So Job died, being old and <em>full of days</em>.”<a id='r332'></a><a href='#f332' class='c014'><sup>[332]</sup></a>
It is probable that the phrase “old and full of days,” which
sounds strange in our ears, simply refers to the instinct of
death, developed in well preserved old men who had attained
ages of from 140 to 180 years.<a id='r333'></a><a href='#f333' class='c014'><sup>[333]</sup></a> The Biblical phrase is not
merely a commonplace phrase applied to the death of celebrities
for the references to deaths of other persons were put
in different language. “And these are the years of the life
of Ishmael, an hundred and thirty and seven years: and he
gave up the ghost and died; and was gathered unto his
people.”<a id='r334'></a><a href='#f334' class='c014'><sup>[334]</sup></a> “And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt
seventeen years: so the whole age of Jacob was an hundred
forty and seven years.”<a id='r335'></a><a href='#f335' class='c014'><sup>[335]</sup></a> “And Aaron was an hundred
and twenty and three years old when he died in Mount
Hor.”<a id='r336'></a><a href='#f336' class='c014'><sup>[336]</sup></a> “And Moses was an hundred and twenty years
old when he died; his eye was not dim, nor his natural
force abated.”<a id='r337'></a><a href='#f337' class='c014'><sup>[337]</sup></a> In only one of these later cases had the
individual reached the age of one hundred and forty
years, at which age, apparently, the instinct of natural
death appeared.</p>

<p class='c007'>It may seem altogether surprising and improbable to us
that an instinct for death should arise in man, since we are
imbued with an instinct of an opposite nature. From the
facts that I collected in my sixth chapter, it was to be
inferred plainly that the desire of life and the fear of death
are manifestations of an instinct deep-rooted in the constitution
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>of man. That instinct is of the same order as the
instincts of hunger and thirst, of the need of sleep, of movement
and of sexual and maternal love. The devotion and
care bestowed on their young by female birds and mammals
are known universally. And yet these instincts can be
reversed. There is no sacrifice of which the mothers are
not capable if it serve to save the life or promote the well-being
of their offspring. Such devotion is a manifestation
of the maternal instinct, which is one of the strongest
instincts known to us. And yet that love, so tender and so
absolute, lasts only for the time during which the wants
of the young need to be satisfied. As soon as the young
begin to be independent, the maternal love changes to
indifference or to dislike. At the next breeding-period,
maternal love reappears again, so that there is a periodic
ebb and flow of the instinct.</p>

<p class='c007'>The new-born babe takes an instinctive delight in the
milk of his mother, which seems to him the only good food
in the world. As soon as he can show his feelings, his
intense satisfaction as he is suckled is plain. But this
instinct lasts only during the period of lactation. As soon
as the child begins to take different kinds of food, he ceases
to be pleased with his mother’s milk, and may dislike it
for the remainder of his life. Several adults to whom I have
offered human milk would not even taste it, so disgusting
did it seem to them. And yet the taste had nothing intrinsically
disagreeable in it. Here again is an example
of a strong instinct that changes completely.</p>

<p class='c007'>Children often eat to repletion of some kind of substance,
and for long afterwards that substance disgusts them instead
of being coveted by them. It is said that apprentices to
pastry-cooks and makers of sweetmeats are allowed at
first to eat as much as they please. They soon come to have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>a profound dislike for the sweet things that children like
so much.</p>

<p class='c007'>A mother who adores her child, or a child who is extremely
fond of sweetmeats cannot understand how any mother
could dislike her offspring or any apprentice have a distaste
for sweets. In the same way, human beings full of the
desire for life, believe more easily in eternal life than in the
possibility of an instinct of death. And yet the instinct
of death seems to lie, in some potential form, deep in the constitution
of man. If the cycle of human life followed its
ideal course according to physiological function, then the
instinct of death would appear in its time, after a normal
life and an old age healthy and prolonged.</p>

<p class='c007'>In reality, human life is subject from its very beginning
to the pernicious disharmonies in the constitution of man.
This evil influence increases with the passing of the years
and leads to an old age ruined by abnormalities. It is not
surprising that under such circumstances men wish neither
to grow old nor to die. Old men, in spite of their attachment
to life, do not attain the capacity to know all that is
good in it, and die, in the fear of death, without having
known the instinct of death. They may be compared with
unhappy women who have married before their sexual instincts
have awakened and who have died in childbirth,
without ever having known the real joy of loving. Formerly,
the number of women in such a case was large. In some
parts of Abyssinia, girls married when they were still very
young and before their physical development was mature.
According to Hassenstein,<a id='r338'></a><a href='#f338' class='c014'><sup>[338]</sup></a> nearly one third of these young
women died in childbirth. They quitted life before they
had known the true sexual instinct. The advancement
of civilisation and of medical knowledge has greatly reduced
<span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>the number of such unhappy women. We must hope that
the progress of knowledge will bring about a similar advance
in relation to the instinct of death. With that progress,
the number of men who will live until the instinct has
been attained will become greater and greater.</p>

<p class='c006'>Man, who is a descendant of some anthropoid ape, has
inherited a constitution adapted to an environment very
different from that which now surrounds him. Man is
possessed of a brain very much more highly developed than
that of his ancestors, and has entered on a new path in the
evolution of the higher organisms. The sudden change
in his natural conditions has brought about a large series
of organic disharmonies which become more and more
acutely felt as he becomes more intelligent and more sensitive.
And thus there has arisen a number of sorrows which
poor humanity has tried to relieve by all the means in its
power. The disharmonies in the sexual functions have
brought into existence attempted remedies of the strangest
kind. The greatest disharmony of the constitution is that
of the morbid nature of old age and the impossibility of
reaching the instinct of natural death; this has produced
childish and erroneous conceptions of the immortality of
the soul and of the resurrection of the body, and many other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>strange doctrines that have been imposed upon us as revealed
truth.</p>

<p class='c007'>Human intelligence, in the course of its progressive evolution,
has rebelled against these naïve palliatives. Finding
the restoration of the much-desired harmony beyond its
power, humanity became resigned to a passive fatalism,
and believed even that the existence of man was a kind
of bad joke, a <em>faux pas</em> in the evolution of sentient organisms.
Exact science, developing slowly, but surely, has at last
tried to master the situation. Moving step by step, passing
from the simple to the complex and from the particular
to the general, science has established a set of truths which
all the world must accept.</p>

<p class='c007'>Humanity in its misery has put question after question
to science, and has lost patience at the slowness of the
advance of knowledge. It has declared that the answers
already found by science are futile and of little interest.
From time to time it has preferred to turn back, and to
delude itself with the beautiful mirages offered by religions
and systems of philosophy.</p>

<p class='c007'>But science, confident of its methods, has quietly continued
to work. Little by little, the answers to some of
the questions that have been set have begun to appear.
Whence do we come? science has been asked unceasingly.
Is not man a being unlike other beings, made in the image
of God, animated with the divine breath, and immortal?
No, science answers. Man is a kind of miscarriage of an
ape, endowed with profound intelligence and capable of
great progress. His brain is the seat of processes that are
very complex, and much higher than those of other animals,
but these functions are incompatible with the existence
of an immortal soul.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whither are we going? That question above all other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_287'>287</span>things has absorbed the attention of man, and naturally
so, for it is less important to know our origin than to know
our destiny. Does death mean absolute extinction, or is
it a gateway leading to a new and everlasting life? And
if the latter alternative be untrue, how are we to face inevitable
death?</p>

<p class='c007'>Science cannot admit the immortality of the conscious
soul, for consciousness is a function of special elements in
the body that certainly cannot live for ever. Immortality
exists only for very low organisms that renew their lives
by repeated divisions with complete regeneration, and
that have no highly developed consciousness.</p>

<p class='c007'>Death brings absolute extinction, and it seems unbearable
because of the condition in which it surprises us. It comes
before man has finished his physiological development,
and when the instinct of life is still strong.</p>

<p class='c007'>Ever since man has begun to look a little beyond his
daily and immediate wants, he has asked if there be a goal for
his life, and what that goal may be. As he has generally
failed to find such a goal, he has gone the length of believing
life to be a mere accident, and of thinking it idle to seek a
goal. He has formed depressing and pessimistic conclusions.
Humanity may be compared to a boy that has not
yet acquired the sexual instinct, but has asked the meaning
of the reproductive organs. As these organs play no part
in the functions of his life, he might easily think their
existence not only absolutely useless but absurd.</p>

<p class='c007'>Man, because of the fundamental disharmonies in his
constitution, does not develop normally. The earlier
phases of his development are passed through with little
trouble; but, after maturity, greater or lesser abnormality
begins, and ends in old age and death that are premature
and pathological. Is not the goal of existence the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>accomplishment of a complete and physiological cycle,
in which occurs a normal old age ending in the loss of the
instinct of life and the appearance of the instinct of death.</p>

<p class='c007'>The pessimistic school has often spoken of death as the
true goal of human life. Schopenhauer,<a id='r339'></a><a href='#f339' class='c014'><sup>[339]</sup></a> for instance,
said: “Death must really be regarded as the true goal of
life; when it comes it at once adjusts all that has been preparing
in the course of life.” Baudelaire<a id='r340'></a><a href='#f340' class='c014'><sup>[340]</sup></a> has exactly the
same idea in his verse:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c022'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“<span lang="fr">C’est la mort qui console, hélas! et qui fait vivre;</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr"><em>C’est le but de la vie</em>, et c’est le seul espoir</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr">Qui, comme un élixir, nous monte et nous enivre</span></div>
      <div class='line'><span lang="fr">Et nous donne le cœur de marcher jusqu’au soir.</span>”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c021'>“Alas! it is death that comforts and gives us life; it is the
goal of our days, it is our only hope that like a wine goes
to our head and makes us drunk, and puts heart into us
to journey on till the night.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The normal end, coming after the appearance of the
instinct of death, may truly be regarded as the ultimate
goal of human existence. But before attaining it, a normal
life must be lived: a life filled all through with the feeling
that comes from the accomplishment of function. Knowledge
of the true goal of life clears up the problem and
shows us the right conduct of life. In my first chapter,
I tried to lay before the reader a summary of the views that
have been held as to right conduct. Ever since the attempt
has been made to discover a rational basis of morality,
human nature, regarded essentially as good, has been taken
as that basis. Religions and systems of philosophy, on the
other hand, which have tried to find another foundation
for morality, have regarded human nature as vicious at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>the roots. Science has been able to tell us that man, the
descendant of animals, has good and evil qualities in his
nature, and that his life is made unhappy by the evil qualities.
But the constitution of man is not immutable, and
perhaps it may be changed for the better.</p>

<p class='c007'>Morality should be based not on human nature in its
existing vitiated condition, but on human nature, ideal,
as it may be in the future. Before all things, it is necessary
to try to amend the evolution of the human life, that is to
say, to transform its disharmonies into harmonies (<em>Orthobiosis</em>).
This task can be undertaken only by science, and
to science the opportunity of accomplishing it must be
given. However, even in the most civilised countries,
science is far from being in this ideal condition. Obstacles
lie in its way and retard its advance.</p>

<p class='c007'>To make the human constitution better, it would be
necessary to know it thoroughly. How can we try to transform
to a normal and physiological condition old age, at
present utterly pathological, unless we first understand the
most intimate details of its mechanism? Deeply rooted
prejudices make it very difficult to examine the organs of
the aged dead. The difficulties surrounding post-mortem
investigations are almost insurmountable. According to
the regulations enforced in France, autopsies cannot be
made until twenty-four hours after death. An autopsy
cannot be made except when the corpse has not been
claimed by any relatives in the direct line, husband or wife,
brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts, nephews, nieces. If kinsmen
put in no claim, co-operative societies may take possession
of the corpse and oppose the holding of an examination.
Even when an examination has been permitted, it
must extend only to “the ascertaining of exact facts, and
this must be taken as excluding the mutilation of the corpse
<span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>by the removal of any organ or portion of the anatomy,
however interesting scientifically such material might be.”
(Circular of the Director of “Assistance publique,” January
20, 1900.<a id='r341'></a><a href='#f341' class='c014'><sup>[341]</sup></a>) It is easy to see that such regulations make
extremely difficult the investigation of senile degeneration,
and the search for means of preventing it, especially by the
use of serums obtained after injecting emulsions of human
organs. These difficulties in reality arise from the prejudice
in favour of the existence of a life beyond the grave
and a resurrection of the body.</p>

<p class='c007'>Almost similar difficulties stand in the way of obtaining
the bodies of old animals. Their owners prefer to keep
animals, after they are useless, until they die, and to bury
the bodies instead of devoting them to the scientific investigation
that is so important to humanity.</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as we come to believe that the solution of the
problems of human happiness will come not from religions
nor from systems of metaphysical philosophy, but from
exact science alone, the obstacles to progress will be removed.
That scientific methods will redress the disharmonies of
the human constitution is the more probable inasmuch as
the old age of human beings was more physiological, and
their death more natural, in earlier times than they are
to-day.</p>

<p class='c007'>The study of the human constitution not only denotes
the real goal of our existence, but indicates to us what is
meant by true culture and real progress.</p>

<p class='c007'>In earlier chapters, I have shown that philosophers have
recognised the existence in man of a tendency to culture
and progress. But what do they mean by these two words?
Attempts have been made to define them as clearly as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>possible, and Herbert Spencer, the greatest of living philosophers,
has devoted a special essay to the subject. He examined
those phenomena that he regarded as progressive,
first in the inorganic world, next, in the world of living things,
and, finally, in humanity. He regards as progressive only
the changes that tend to increase human happiness, and it
is precisely on account of that tendency that he regards them
as progressive. In order to define progressive phenomena
Spencer thinks it necessary to make parallel studies of
them in man and the animal world. He finds that progress
is marked always by a transformation from the simple and
uniform to the complex; and that it produces constant
differentiation, in the evolution of the planetary world,
in the embryonic development of the individual, and in the
societies of men and animals. But differentiation is not
a complete account of progress, for in the latter must be
included the change of the indefinite into the definite.
Spencer identifies progress with evolution, and his well-known
definition of evolution is, that it is “an integration
of matter and concomitant dissipation of motion; during
which the matter passes from an indefinite, incoherent
homogeneity to a definite, coherent heterogeneity; and
during which the retained motion undergoes a parallel
transformation.” Such a formula embraces too much, so
that he is rather vague, especially when he applies it to
human affairs. Differentiation in itself is not the whole
of progress. It is necessary in each concrete case to inquire
into its limits and modifications.</p>

<p class='c007'>The application of his theory of progress and evolution
led Spencer, in his investigation of the basis of morality,
to define human progress as the tendency towards a life
as full and as long as possible. By fulness he means complexity,
if I interpret his argument correctly. Civilised
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>life as compared with savage life, is a realisation of progress.
Civilised man, according to Spencer, uses food in a better
regulated fashion, in accordance with the call and degree
of his appetite; the food is of better quality, it is freed from
contamination, is much more varied and is better prepared.
The same differentiation distinguishes the clothing, the
homes and so forth of civilised man. According to Spencer,
all such progress helps real happiness, that is to say the
fulness and the prolongation of life.</p>

<p class='c007'>It is easy to see, however, that such an interpretation
of progress is inexact, like the conception of the goal of life
associated with it. If the complication of the mode of life,
which is so marked in modern civilisation, is really the best
way of reaching happiness, there are no reasons to arrest
the tendency in that direction. If, on the other hand, my
view be correct, that true progress consists in the elimination
of the disharmonies of human nature and in the cultivation
of physiological old age followed by natural death,
the conditions for realising progress would be different and
very clear. The great complexity of life in modern civilisation
is a sign of progress according to Spencer, but I do not
agree with him. Spencer speaks of the variety and preparation
of food. It is certain that this complexity militates
against physiological old age, and that the simpler food of
uncivilised races is better. I do not wish to write an essay
on domestic hygiene, and I shall be content with saying
that most of the delicate dishes provided in the homes,
hotels, and restaurants of the rich, stimulate the organs of
digestion and secretion in a harmful way. It would be true
progress to abandon modern cuisine and to go back to the
simple dishes of our ancestors. One of the conditions that
enabled the Jews of the earlier Biblical times to live longer
than civilised people, was, beyond all doubt, the greater
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>simplicity of their diet. True hygiene, which is in open
disagreement with the elaborated art of cookery, is also
opposed to the differentiation of modern dress and dwellings.
Progress thus would consist in simplifying many sides of
the lives of civilised people.</p>

<p class='c007'>The luxury which has done so much harm to mankind,
and which would be included in the formula, “passage
from indefinite homogeneity to definite heterogeneity,”
is founded not on a general law of evolution of the whole
universe, but on a particular conception of life, quite
different from mine according to which the rectifying of
the abnormal human cycle to a normal cycle is the true
goal of life.</p>

<p class='c007'>Perhaps one of the oldest conceptions of life that has
tended to luxury is to be found in the book of Ecclesiastes.
Having reached the conclusion: “For in much wisdom
is much grief: and he that increaseth knowledge increaseth
sorrow” (i. 18), and having said: “Then I beheld all
the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that
is done under the sun: because though a man labour to
seek it out, yet he shall not find it, yea farther; though a
wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able to find
it.”<a id='r342'></a><a href='#f342' class='c014'><sup>[342]</sup></a> Solomon laid down the rules of life as follows: “Go
thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with
a merry heart: for God now accepteth thy works.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head
lack no ointment.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the
days of the life of thy vanity, which he hath given thee
under the sun, all the days of thy vanity; for that is thy
portion in this life, and in thy labour which thou takest
under the sun.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>“Whatsoever thy hand findest to do, do it with thy
might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge,
nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.”<a id='r343'></a><a href='#f343' class='c014'><sup>[343]</sup></a></p>

<p class='c007'>The wisdom of Solomon was to enjoy this life as much
as possible, since man is unable to solve the problem of the
goal of life. His precepts have been taken as a guide, and
have led to an organisation of life that could only become
more and more epicurean.</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as the goal of life has been seen clearly, luxury
ceases to be true happiness as it hinders the making perfect
of the normal cycle of human life. Young people, instead
of abandoning themselves to all the pleasures because they
have nothing before them but a sad prospect of morbid
old age and death, ought to make ready for physiological
old age and natural death. The apprenticeship certainly
will be long. In our time the years of study already last
much longer than occurred even a century ago. As the body
of knowledge grows greater, the time to acquire it will
become prolonged, but this period of preparation will serve
as the prelude to ripe maturity and ideal old age.</p>

<p class='c007'>Old age is repulsive at present, because it is an old age
devoid of its true meaning, full of egoism, narrowness of
view, incapacity and malignancy. The physiological old
age of the future assuredly will be very different. In the
societies of animals, especially as they occur among insects,
the members show a high degree of differentiation. Some
individuals are adapted to the reproductive functions, while
others are sterile and are fitted for the care of the young
and to supply the wants of the community. This differentiation,
which is of social value, has arisen independently in
different groups. Thus, in the societies of bees and ants the
workers are sterile females, while in the case of termites,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>individuals of both sexes may be sterile. In the human
race, evolution is following another path. There is no sign
of the appearance of a sterile class; but, as the life of man
is longer than that of insects, it is divided into two periods,
a reproductive period and a sterile period. Old age, at
present practically a useless burden on the community,
will become a period of work valuable to the community.
As the old man will no longer be subject to loss of memory
or to intellectual weakness, he will be able to apply his
great experience to the most complicated and the most
delicate parts of the social life.</p>

<p class='c007'>Young men are usually very bad politicians, and in
countries where they take a large share in public affairs
they do much harm because they are without the necessary
practical knowledge. Their incapacity is clearly shown
by the great changes in their political views as they advance
in years and gain experience. In the future, old men will
have charge of all complex and difficult social functions.
Thus, vast improvements will be made in politics and in
justice, which at present are defective because of their
insufficient foundations.</p>

<p class='c007'>As soon as every one has recognised the true goal of human
life, and has assumed, as the ideal, the realisation of the normal
cycle of life, a real guide to life will have been found. We
shall know at least whither we are going, and as yet we are
ignorant of that. We have wished to make life better,
but we have not known how or for whom to make the
attempt. Formerly it was assumed that, in the future, love
would spread and become generalised. Family love had
spread to the tribe and then had been transformed to patriotism;
it was held that no obstacle stood in the way of its
embracing all humanity. Such an idea was prevalent in
the eighteenth century, and became a common ground of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>all systems of philosophy, morality and politics. But, since
means of communication have been improved so vastly
and since the most distant voyages are within the power
of almost every one, the vague notion of “humanity” has
been replaced by exact knowledge of the native savages
in many parts of the earth. We have come to disbelieve
in “humanity” in the old sense of the word, so great is the
difference between savage and civilised peoples. And many
modern theories have rejected the inclusion of the lower
races in the sentiment of humanity. In the fifth chapter,
I quoted the view of the moralist, Sutherland, on the advantages
that have come about from the English seizure of the
forests that belonged to the natives of Australia. Moreover,
it is well known that a profound hatred exists between
white men and black men in several parts of the earth,
notably in America and the Antilles. Such instances
could be multiplied.</p>

<p class='c007'>How then are we to emerge from this difficulty? At
what point is the love of the future to be stayed, if it cannot
spread to all humanity?</p>

<p class='c007'>In a recently published treatise on natural philosophy,
Ostwald,<a id='r344'></a><a href='#f344' class='c014'><sup>[344]</sup></a> a very distinguished German physical chemist,
has discussed this question. He calls good “the actions that
made easier the existence of other men.” But to what other
men are we to apply this rule? “What is the size of the
circle of altruistic love,” asked Ostwald. “The general feeling,”
he said, “is that it should cover the family and the nation.
The feeling that it should cover all humanity appears to
most of us as a theoretical demand rather than something
practical. And thus have not most of us the tendency
to limit our altruistic actions much more in the case of men
beneath us than in the case of our social comrades (Stadesgenossen)?”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>According to this formula, moral action
would not stretch beyond our compatriots, and humanity
as a whole would be excluded from it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Here we have entered on a problem relating to the
principles of normal life. In former times, religion was the
chief bond among men. Later on, religion gave way to
patriotism, which in default of anything better still holds
its place. Community of language unites the individuals of
a nation, but the advance of civilisation has undermined
the foundation of that source of differentiation. Naturally,
when a number of men spoke only one and the same language,
great solidarity was the result, as ideas spread only
by language. But such a monoglottism is not the end of
human progress. As means of communication have improved,
the nations have been brought in contact with each
other. The knowledge of foreign languages is an elementary
necessity of modern life. And so the bonds of nationality
certainly will become looser, in this respect following the
bonds of family. The dislike that we have to people whose
language we do not understand, becomes changed into a
feeling of unity with them as soon as we can understand
them. In that respect an active development is in progress,
and we shall have to seek out some new principle on which
to base international solidarity. A good deal has been
made of the possession by different nations of the same
culture, but the vagueness of the phrase has not been
realised. Recognition of the true goal of life and of
science as the only means by which that goal may be
attained would form an ideal on which men might unite;
they would group themselves around that, as in former
days men were held together by religion.</p>

<p class='c007'>I think it extremely probable that the scientific study
of old age and of death, two branches of science that may
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>be called <em>gerontology</em> and <em>thanatology</em>, will bring about great
modifications in the course of the last period of life. All
that we know on these subjects confirms my view. But will
it lead to the development of an instinct of death? That
instinct lies deep in the roots of the human constitution?
Will the means be found to bring it to the surface? Has
not the enormous period during which it has remained
latent led to its atrophy? The science of the future
alone can answer that question. But the persistence of
organs and structures that are extremely ancient, as for
instance, the survival of the mammary glands in males and
of the vermiform appendage in anthropoid apes and man,
gives us the hope that the instinct of natural death may
emerge from its latent condition when old age has become a
normal process.</p>

<p class='c007'>The mammary glands of males are functionless rudiments.
They must be interpreted as vestiges of organs that were
more highly developed in remote ancestors among which both
sexes gave milk to nourish the young. This function exists
in a latent condition in the males of living mammals. Extremely
rare cases have existed in which males possessed
large glands secreting enough milk to feed the young.
These males, it is true, had the genital organs either very
badly developed or in a condition approaching hermaphroditism.<a id='r345'></a><a href='#f345' class='c014'><sup>[345]</sup></a>
But in other authentic cases (perfectly developed)
he-goats and rams have been known to provide milk in
considerable quantities, whilst married men have suckled
children with milk secreted by unusually developed glands.
It is stated that the secretion of milk can be excited by
stimulation of the nipples.<a id='r346'></a><a href='#f346' class='c014'><sup>[346]</sup></a> Such examples of the reappearance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>of a latent property that has been lost for untold ages
are extremely important.</p>

<p class='c007'>Probably actual cases of the instinct of natural death
in man are as rare as instances of the secretion of milk by
males. But favouring circumstances and some education
of the instinct of death would probably reawaken it and
develop it fully. There is much work to be done before
so great an object can be achieved. But it is the peculiar
feature of science to be eager for much labour, while religions
and systems of metaphysical philosophy are content with
passive fatalism and silent resignation. The mere hope of
being able to solve the great problems of humanity in the
more or less distant future brings much satisfaction. When
Tolstoi, agonised by the impossibility of solving the great
problems, and haunted by the fear of death, asked if the
love of our children is not able to sooth our souls, he found
that such a hope was vain. “What is the good,” he said,
“of rearing children who will soon find themselves in the
same difficult position as their parents?” “Why should
they live? why should I love them and protect them and
foster them? Is it that they may come to the same despair
as I am in myself or else grow imbecile? As I love them,
I do not wish to hide the truth from them, for each step in
knowledge will lead them nearer to it. But the truth is—death.”
I can understand that many persons would
abstain from having children if they had come to these
pessimistic conclusions.</p>

<p class='c007'>The point of view that I have exposed in this book will
make life more possible. Our generation has no chance
of attaining physiological old age and normal death; but
it may take real consolation from the thought that those
who are now young may advance several steps in that
direction. It may reflect that each succeeding generation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>will get closer and closer to the solution and that true
happiness one day will be reached by mankind.</p>

<p class='c007'>The slow advance to happiness will demand many sacrifices.
Already, men of science sacrifice their health and
sometimes their life to reach the solution of some important
problem, as for instance, to clear up a medical question,
and so be ready to heal or to save the lives of their fellows.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before it is possible to reach the goal, mankind must be
persuaded that science is all-powerful and that the deeply
rooted existing superstitions are pernicious. It will be
necessary to reform many customs and many institutions
that now seem to rest on enduring foundations. The
abandonment of much that is habitual and a revolution
in the mode of education will require long and painful effort.</p>

<p class='c007'>Definition of the goal of human existence will bring great
precision to the principles of morality. True policy will
have to be reared on new foundations. The politics of to-day
are in the condition in which medicine still remained
in days long past. In the old days any one was allowed
to practise medicine, because there was no medical science
and nothing was exact. Even at the present time, among
less civilised people, any old woman is allowed to be a midwife.
In some cases the mother attends the labour of her
daughter, or (as for instance in a caste of natives in Malabar),
it may be the mother-in-law who does the duty. Very often
friends act as midwives. Among more civilised races,
differentiation has taken place, and childbirths are attended
by women of special training, who are midwives by diploma.
In the case of nations still more civilised, the trained midwives
are directed by obstetric physicians who have specialised
in the conducting of labour. This high degree of
differentiation has arisen with, and has itself aided, the
progress of obstetric knowledge.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>Politics, as they exist to-day, correspond to the early
stages of obstetric practice. Every adult male is thought
fit for exercising functions so difficult as those of an elector
or a juryman. The only excuse for this condition is that
political science is in its infancy. When sociology is more
advanced, there will come about a differentiation like that
in medicine. When that has taken place, old persons who
have acquired great experience, and who because of their
physiological constitutions have preserved all their faculties,
will give most valuable services to the society of the future.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the progress towards the real goal of life, men will lose
much of their liberty, but will receive in exchange a new
feeling of solidarity. As knowledge becomes more and
more extensive and exact, freedom to neglect it will be
more and more limited. Formerly any one was at liberty
to teach that whales were fish; but now that it has been
proved that whales are mammals, the mistake is not to be
pardoned. Since medicine has become more of an exact
science, the liberty of doctors has been restrained. Practitioners
have already been sentenced for neglecting antisepsis
and asepsis. Other forms of freedom, such as the freedom
to neglect vaccination against smallpox, to spit on the floor,
or to let dogs run loose without being muzzled, are worthy
of savage days and will cease as civilisation advances.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the other hand, the knowledge that the goal of human
life can be attained only by the development of a high degree
of solidarity amongst men will restrain actual egotism. The
mere fact that the enjoyment of life according to the precepts
of Solomon is opposed to the goal of human life will
lessen luxury and the evil that comes from luxury. Conviction
that science alone is able to redress the disharmonies
of the human constitution will lead directly to the improvement
of education and to the solidarity of mankind.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>In progress towards the goal, nature will have to be consulted
continuously. Already, in the case of the ephemerids,
nature has produced a complete cycle of normal life
ending in natural death. In the problem of his own fate,
man must not be content with the gifts of nature; he must
direct them by his own efforts. Just as he has been able
to modify the nature of animals and plants, man must
attempt to modify his own constitution, so as to readjust
its disharmonies.</p>

<p class='c007'>Breeders form a conception of the ideal result when they
are about to attempt the production of some new variety
which shall be pleasing esthetically and of service to man.
Next, they study the existing individual variations in
animals and plants on which they wish to work, and from
which they will select with the minutest care. The ideal
result must have some relation to the constitution of the
organisms selected.</p>

<p class='c007'>To modify the human constitution, it will be necessary
first, to frame the ideal, and thereafter to set to work with
all the resources of science.</p>

<p class='c007'>If there can be formed an ideal able to unite men in a
kind of religion of the future, this ideal must be founded
on scientific principles. And if it be true, as has been
asserted so often, that man can live by faith alone, the faith
must be in the power of science.</p>

<p class='c007'>Author of</p>

<p class='c007'><em>12º. $1.00 net</em></p>

<p class='c007'>This work deals with the problem
of personality, especially as raised by
William James and M. Bergson. If a
man imagines himself bound, in deference
to science or psychology, to deny
the existence of personality, he commits
himself to saying “I do not exist.” If
he shrinks from that absurdity, he must
accept personality as a reality: a person
is both a subject who knows others and
an object of others’ knowledge. The
bond, however, which holds persons,
human and divine, together, cannot be
merely intellectual: it must be emotional
as well as intellectual—the bond of love.</p>

<p class='c007'>This is not a history of geographical exploration,
though the leading episodes in the advance
of our knowledge of the face of the Earth are
necessarily referred to in tracing the evolution
of geography as a department of science.
The author hopes that in the attempt to tell
the story of the evolution of geography up
to the present day, it will be evident that it
is as amenable to scientific methods as any
other department of human knowledge, and
that it performs important functions which are
untouched by any other line of research.</p>

    <div>The</div>
    <div>Science of Happiness</div>

<p class='c006'>By Jean Finot</p>

<p class='c007'>Author of “Problem of the Sexes,” etc.</p>

<p class='c007'>Translated from the French by
Mary J. Safford</p>

<p class='c007'><em>8º. $1.75 net</em></p>

<p class='c007'>The author considers a subject, the solution of
which offers more enticement to the well-wisher
of the race than the gold of the Incas did to the
treasure-seekers of Spain, who themselves doubtless
looked upon the coveted yellow metal,
however mistakenly, as a key to the happiness
which all are trying to find. “Amid the noisy
tumult of life, amid the dissonance that divides
man from man,” remarks M. Finot, “the
Science of Happiness tries to discover the
divine link which binds humanity to happiness
through the soul and through the union
of souls.” The author considers the nature
of happiness and the means of its attainment,
as well as many allied questions.</p>
